    "lyrics": "I'm a pilgrim and a stranger,\nRough and thorny is the road,\nOften in the midst of danger,\nBut it leads to God.\nClouds and darkness oft distress me,\nGreat and many are my foes;\nAnxious cares and thoughts oppress me,\nBut my Father knows.\n\nOh, how sweet is this assurance,\nMid the conflict and the strife,\nAlthough sorrows past endurance,\nFollow me through life.\nHome in prospect still can cheer me,\nYes, and give me sweet repose;\nWhile I feel His presence near me,\nFor my Father knows.\n\nYes, He sees and knows me daily,\nWatches over me in love;\nSends me help when foes assail me,\nBids me look above.\nSoon my journey will be ended,\nLife is drawing to a close;\nI shall then be well attended,\nThis my Father knows.\n\nI shall then with joy behold Him,\nFace to face my Father see,\nFall with rapture and adore Him,\nFor His love to me.\nNothing more shall then distress me,\nIn the Land of sweet repose;\nJesus stands engaged to bless me,\nThis my Father knows."
