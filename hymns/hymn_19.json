    "lyrics": "Jesu, Lover of my soul,\nLet me to Thy bosom fly,\nWhile the nearer waters roll,\nWhile the tempest still is high:\nHide me, O my Savior, hide\nTill the storm of life is past;\nSafe into the haven guide,\nO receive my soul at last.\n\nOther refuge have I none,\nHangs my helpless soul on Thee,\nLeave, oh! leave me not alone,\nStill support and comfort me:\nAll my trust on Thee is stayed\nAll my help from Thee I bring;\nCover my defenseless head\nWith the shadow of Thy wing.\n\nThou, O Christ, art all I want,\nMore than all in Thee I find,\nRaise the fallen, cheer the faint,\nHeal the sick, and lead the blind:\nJust and Holy is Thy name,\nI am all unrighteousness;\nVile and full of sin I am,\nThou art full of truth and grace.\n\nPlenteous grace with Thee is found,\nGrace to cover all my sin;\nLet the healing streams abound,\nMake and keep me pure within:\nThou of life the fountain art,\nFreely let me take of Thee\nSpring Thou up within my heart,\nRise to all eternity. Amen"
