    "lyrics": "Rescue the perishing,\nCare for the dying,\nSnatch them in pity\nFrom sin and the grave;\nWeep o'er the erring one,\nLift up the fallen,\nTell them of Jesus,\nThe mighty to save.\n\nCHORUS\nRescue the perishing,\nCare for the dying,\nJesus is merciful,\nJesus will save.\n\nTho they are slighting Him,\nStill He is waiting,\nWaiting the penitent\nChild to receive;\nPlead with them earnestly,\nPlead with them gently,\nHe will forgive\nIf they only believe.\n\nDown in the human heart,\nCrushed by the tempter,\nFeelings lie buried\nThat grace can restore;\nTouched by a loving heart,\nWakened by kindness,\nChords that were broken\nWill vibrate once more.\n\nRescue the perishing,\nDuty demands it\nStrength for thy labour\nThe Lord will provide;\nBack to the narrow way\nPatiently win them,\nTell the poor wanderer\nA Saviour has died."
