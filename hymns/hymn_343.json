    "lyrics": "Be still my soul,\nThe Lord is on thy side,\nBear patiently the cross\nOf grief or pain,\nLeave to Thy God,\nTo order and provide,\nIn every change,\nHe faithful will remain,\nBe still my soul,\nThy best, Thy Heavenly friend,\nThru thorny ways\nLeads to a joyful end.\n\nBe still my soul,\nThy God doth undertake,\nTo guide the future\nAs He has the past,\nThy Hope, Thy confidence\nLet nothing shake,\nAll now mysterious\nShall be bright at last,\nBe still, my soul, the waves\nAnd winds still know\nHis voice who ruled them\nWhile He dwelt below.\n\nBe still my soul,\nThe hour is hast'ning on,\nWhen we shall be forever\nWith the Lord,\nWhen disappointment,\nGrief and fear are gone,\nSorrow forgot love's\nPurest joys restored,\nBe still, my soul,\nWhen change and tears are past,\nAll safe and blessed,\nWe shall meet at last."
