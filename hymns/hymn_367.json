Angels we have heard on high,\nSweetly singing o'er the plains\nAnd the mountain in reply,\nEcho back their joyous strains.\n\nCHORUS:\nGloria in excelsis Deo\nGloria in excelsis Deo.\n\n2. Shepherds why this jubilee?\nWhy your joyous strains prolong?\nSay what may the tidings be\nWhich inspire your Heav'nly song?\n\n3. Come to Bethlehem and see,\nHim whose birth the Angels sing,\nCome adore on bended knee,\nChrist the Lord the newborn King.\n\n4. See within a manger laid,\nJesus, Lord of Heav'n and Earth\nMary Joseph lend your aid,\nWith us sing our Saviour's birth."
