    "lyrics": "I was out on the broad way,\nOf sin and despair\nCrushed neath my burden\nOf sorrow and care\nMy constant companions\nWere trouble and doubt,\nTill Jesus reached down\nAnd lifted me out.\n\nCHORUS:\nHe lifted me out\nOf the deep miry clay,\nHe settled my feet\nIn the strait narrow way,\nHe lifted me up\nTo a Heavenly place\nAnd floodeth my soul\nEach day with His grace.\n\nI was wandering afar\nFrom my Saviour and home,\nFainting and weary, In sin did I roam,\nI needed a hand to turn me about\nThen Jesus reached down\nAnd lifted me out.\n\nI was building my home\nOn the dry shifting sand\nCasting my lot in a\nCold barren land,\nYou're doomed now for aye\nI heard Satan shout\nBut Jesus reached down\nAnd lifted me out.\n\nI have started for Heaven\nMy heart filled with song\nWandering is over\nMy sins all are gone\nThrough Jesus' own blood\nCleansed within and without\nO praise His dear name\nHe lifted me out."
