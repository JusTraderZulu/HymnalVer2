    "lyrics": "1. 'Twas Jesus, my Saviour,\nWho died on the tree,\nTo open a fountain\nFor sinners like me;\nHis blood is that fountain\nWhich pardon bestows\nAnd cleanses the foulest\nWherever it flows.\n\nChorus:\nFor the Lion of Judah\nShall break every chain\nAnd give us the victory\nAgain and again.\n\n2. And when I was willing\nWith all things to part\nHe gave me His blessing,\nHis love in my heart\nSo now I am joined with\nThe conquering band,\nWho are marching to glory\nAt Jesus' command.\n\n3. Though round me the\nStorms of adversity roll\nAnd the waves of destruction\nEncompass my soul\nIn vain this frail vessel\nThe tempest shall toss;\nMy hope is secure through\nThe blood of the cross.\n\n4. And when with the ransomed,\nBy Jesus, my head,\nFrom fountain to fountain\nI then shall be led\nI'll fall at His feet\nAnd His mercy adore,\nAnd sing Hallelujah to God evermore."
