Away in a manger\nNo crib for a bed,\nThe little Lord Jesus\nLaid down His sweet head,\nThe stars in the bright sky\nLooked down where He lay\nThe little Lord Jesus\nAsleep on the hay.\n\n2. The cattle are lowing\nThe baby awakes,\nBut little Lord Jesus\nNo crying He makes,\nI love Thee Lord Jesus\nLook down from the sky,\nAnd stay by my cradle\nTill morning is nigh.\n\n3. Be near me Lord Jesus\nI ask Thee to stay,\nClose by me forever\nAnd love me I pray,\nBless all the dear children\nIn Thy tender care\nAnd take us to Heaven,\nTo live with Thee there."
