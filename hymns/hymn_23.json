    "lyrics": "When peace, like a river\nAttendeth my way,\nWhen sorrows\nLike sea-billows roll,\nWhatever my lot,\nThou hast taught me to say,\n\"It is well,\nIt is well with my soul.\"\n\nCHORUS:\nIt is well,\nWith my soul,\nIt is well,\nIt is well,\nWith my soul.\n\nThough Satan should buffet,\nThough trials should come,\nLet this blest assurance control,\nThat Christ hath regarded\nMy helpless estate,\nAnd hath shed His own blood\nFor my soul.\n\nMy sin O the bliss\nOf this glorious thought!\nMy sin, not in part\nBut the whole,\nIs nailed to His cross\nAnd I bear it no more;\nPraise the Lord,\nPraise the Lord, O my soul!\n\nFor me, be it Christ\nBe it Christ hence to live,\nIf Jordan above me shall roll,\nNo pang shall be mine,\nFor in death as in life,\nThou wilt whisper\nThy peace to my soul.\n\nBut, Lord, 'tis for Thee,\nFor Thy coming we wait,\nThe sky, not the grave,\nIs our goal,\nOh, trump of the Angel;\nOh, voice of the Lord,\nBlessed hope;\nBlessed rest of my soul."
