  "lyrics": "O what a wonderful wonderful day\nDay I will never forget\nAfter I'd wandered in darkness away\nJesus my Savior I met\nO what a tender compassionate friend\nHe met the need of my heart\nShadows dispelling with joy I am telling\nHe made all the darkness depart\n\nHeaven came down and glory filled my\nsoul\nWhen at the cross the Savior made me\nwhole\nMy sins were washed away\nAnd my night was turned to day\nHeaven came down and glory filled my\nsoul\n\nBorn of the Spirit with life from above\nInto God's fam'ly divine\nJustified fully through Calvary's love\nO what a standing is mine\nAnd the transaction so quickly was made\nWhen as a sinner I came\nTook of the offer of grace, He did proffer He\nsaved me\nO praise His dear name\n\nNow I've a hope that will surely endure\nAfter the passing of time\nI have a future in heaven for sure\nThere in those mansions sublime\nAnd it's because of that wonderful day\nWhen at the cross I believed\nRiches eternal and blessings supernal\nFrom His precious hand I received\n\nMy sins were washed away\nAnd my night was turned to day\nHeaven came down and glory filled my soul"
