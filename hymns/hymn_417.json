    "lyrics": "THROUGH the night of doubt and sorrow\nOnward goes the pilgrim band,\nSinging songs of expectation,\nMarching to the Promised Land.\n\nClear before us through the darkness\nGleams and burns the guiding Light;\nBrother clasps the hand of brother,\nStepping fearless through the night.\n\nOne the Light of God's own Presence\nO'er His ransom'd people shed,\nChasing far the gloom and terror,\nBrightening all the path we tread:\n\nOne the object of our journey,\nOne the faith which never tires\nOne the earnest looking forward,\nOne the hope our God inspires:\n\nOne the strain that lips of thousands\nLift as from the heart of one,\nOne the conflict, one the peril,\nOne the march in God begun:\n\nOne the gladness of rejoicing\nOn the far eternal shore\nWhere the One Almighty Father\nReigns in love for evermore.\n\nOnward, therefore, pilgrim brothers,\nOnward with the Cross our aid;\nBear its shame, and fight its battle,\nTill we rest beneath its shade.\n\nSoon shall come the great awaking,\nSoon the rending of the tomb;\nThen the scattering of all shadows,\nAnd the end of toil and gloom."
