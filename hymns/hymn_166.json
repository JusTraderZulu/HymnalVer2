    "lyrics": "1\nThere were ninety and nine that safely lay\nIn the shelter of the fold,\nBut one was out on the hills away,\nFar off from the gates of gold–\nAway on the mountains wild and bare,\nAway from the tender Shepherd’s care,\nAway from the tender Shepherd’s care.\n\n2\n'Lord, Thou hast here Thy ninety and nine;\nAre they not enough for Thee?'\nBut the Shepherd made answer: 'This of mine\nHas wandered away from me;\nAnd although the road be rough and steep,\nI go to the desert to find my sheep,\nI go to the desert to find my sheep.'\n\n3\nBut none of the ransomed ever knew\nHow deep were the waters crossed;\nNor how dark was the night the Lord passed thro'\nEre He found His sheep that was lost.\nOut in the desert He heard its cry–\nSo sick and helpless and ready to die;\nSo sick and helpless and ready to die.\n\n4\n'Lord, whence are those blood-drops all the way\nThat mark out the mountain’s track?'\n'They were shed for one who had gone astray\nEre the Shepherd could bring him back.'\n'Lord, whence are Thy hands so rent and torn?'\n'They are pierced tonight by many a thorn,\nThey are pierced tonight by many a thorn.'\n\n5\nAnd all through the mountains, thunder-riven,\nAnd up from the rocky steep,\nThere arose a glad cry to the gate of heaven,\n'Rejoice! I have found my sheep!'\nAnd the angels echoed around the throne,\n'Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own,\nRejoice, for the Lord brings back His own!'"
