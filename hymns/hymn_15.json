  "lyrics": "Arise, my soul, arise\nShake off thy guilty fears;\nThe bleeding sacrifice\nIn my behalf appears,\nBefore the throne\nMy surety stands;\nMy name is written on\nHis hands.\n\nHe ever lives above,\nFor me to intercede,\nHis all-redeeming love,\nHis precious blood to plead;\nHis blood atoned\nFor all our race,\nAnd sprinkles now\nThe throne of grace.\n\nFive bleeding wounds He bears,\nReceived on Calvary;\nThey pour effectual prayers,\nThey strongly plead for me:\n\"Forgive him, oh, forgive,\" they cry,\n\"Nor let that ransomed\nSinner die.\"\n\nMy God is reconciled;\nHis pardoning voice I hear:\nHe owns me for His child;\nI can no longer fear:\nWith confidence I now draw nigh,\nAnd \"Father, Abba Father,\" cry."
