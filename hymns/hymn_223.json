  "lyrics": "O that I knew\nThe secret place,\nWhere I might find my God,\nI'd spread my wants\nBefore His face,\nAnd pour my woes abroad.\n\nI'd tell Him\nHow my sins arise,\nWhat sorrows I sustain,\nHow grace decays,\nAnd comfort dies\nAnd leaves my heart in pain.\n\nHe knows what arguments\nI'd take,\nTo wrestle with my God,\nI'd plead for His\nOwn mercy's sake,\nAnd for my Saviour's blood.\n\nMy God will pity\nMy complaints,\nAnd heal my broken bones,\nHe takes the meaning\nOf His Saints,\nThe language of their groans.\n\nArise, my soul,\nFrom deep distress,\nAnd banish every fear,\nHe calls Thee to\nHis throne of grace,\nTo spread thy sorrows there."
