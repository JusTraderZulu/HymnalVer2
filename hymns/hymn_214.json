    "lyrics": "1. O to be like Thee!\nBlessed Redeemer,\nThis is my constant\nLonging and prayer;\nGladly Iâ€™ll forfeit\nAll of Earth's treasures,\nJesus, Thy perfect\nLikeness to wear.\n\nRefrain:\nO to be like Thee!\nO to be like Thee,\nBlessed Redeemer,\nPure as Thou art\nCome in Thy sweetness,\nCome in Thy fullness\nStamp Thine own image\nDeep on my heart.\n\n2. O to be like Thee!\nFull of compassion,\nLoving, forgiving,\nTender and kind;\nHelping the helpless,\nCheering the fainting\nSeeking the wandering\nSinner to find.\n\n3. O to be like Thee!\nWhile I am pleading,\nPour out Thy Spirit,\nFill with Thy love;\nMake me a temple\nMeet for Thy dwelling,\nFit me for life\nAnd Heaven above."
