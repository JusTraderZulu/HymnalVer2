    "bio": "Isaac Watts was an English Christian minister, hymn writer, theologian, and logician. He is credited with introducing a new era of English hymnody, moving away from the exclusive singing of Psalms in worship to hymns that expressed personal feelings and faith in Christ. Watts wrote numerous hymns, many of which, like 'This is the Day The Lord Hath Made,' are still sung today. His hymns are known for their theological depth, poetic language, and the incorporation of personal devotion, making a significant impact on Christian worship."

  "lyrics": "1. This is the day the Lord hath made,\nHe calls the hours His own;\nLet heaven rejoice, let earth be glad,\nAnd praise surround the throne.\n\n2. Today He rose and left the dead,\nAnd Satan's empire fell;\nToday the saints His triumphs spread,\nAnd all His wonders tell.\n\n3. Hosanna to the anointed King,\nTo David's holy Son;\nMake haste to help us, Lord,\nAnd bring salvation from Thy throne.\n\n4. Blessed be the Lord,\nWho comes to men,\nWith messages of grace;\nWho comes, in God His Father's name,\nTo save our sinful race.\n\n5. Hosanna in the highest strains\nThe Church on earth can raise;\nThe highest heavens, in which He reigns,\nShall give Him nobler praise."
