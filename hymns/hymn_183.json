    "lyrics": "1. The day Thou gavest, Lord, is ended,\\nThe darkness falls at Thy behest;\\nTo Thee our morning hymns ascended,\\nThy praise shall sanctify our rest.\\n\\n2. We thank Thee that Thy church unsleeping,\\nWhile Earth rolls onward into light,\\nThrough all the world her watch is keeping,\\nAnd rests not now by day or night.\\n\\n3. As o’er each continent and island\\nThe dawn leads on another day,\\nThe voice of prayer is never silent,\\nNor dies the strain of praise away.\\n\\n4. The sun that bids us rest is waking\\nOur brethren ’neath the western sky;\\nAnd hour by hour fresh lips are making\\nThy wondrous doings heard on high.\\n\\n5. So be it, Lord: Thy throne shall never,\\nLike Earth’s proud empires, pass away;\\nThy kingdom stands, and grows for ever,\\nTill all Thy creatures own Thy sway."
