    "lyrics": "1 When upon life’s billows,\nYou are tempest tossed,\nWhen you are discouraged,\nThinking all is lost;\nCount your many blessings;\nName them one by one;\nAnd it will surprise you\nWhat the Lord hath done.\n\nChorus:\nCount your blessings,\nName them one by one,\nCount your blessing\nSee what God hath done\nCount your blessing,\nName them one by one;\nAnd it will surprise you\nWhat the Lord hath done.\n\n2 Are you ever burdened\nWith a load of care?\nDoes the cross seem heavy\nYou are called to bear?\nCount your many blessings\nEvery doubt will fly,\nAnd you will keep singing\nAs the days go by.\n\n3 When you look at others\nWith their lands and gold\nThink that Christ has promised\nYou His wealth untold,\nCount your many blessings;\nWealth can never buy,\nYour reward in Heaven,\nNor your home on high.\n\n4 So, amid the conflict,\nWhether great or small,\nDo not be disheartened,\nGod is over all,\nCount your many blessings,\nAngels will attend,\nHelp and comfort give you\nTo your journey’s end."
