    "lyrics": "I wandered\nIn the shades of night,\nTill Jesus came to me,\nAnd with the sunlight\nOf His love\nBid all my darkness flee.\n\nCHORUS:\nSunlight, sunlight\nIn my soul today,\nSunlight, sunlight\nAll along the way;\nSince the Saviour\nFound me,\nTook away my sin,\nI have had the sunlight\nOf His love within.\n\nThough clouds\nMay gather in the sky,\nAnd billows\nRound me roll,\nHowever dark\nThe world may be,\nI've sunlight in my soul.\n\nWhile walking\nIn the light of God,\nI sweet communion find;\nI press with Holy vigor on,\nAnd leave the world behind.\n\nI cross the wide\nExtended fields,\nI journey o'er the plain,\nAnd in the sunlight of His love,\nI reap the golden grain.\n\nSoon I shall see Him as He is,\nThe light that came to me,\nBehold the brightness\nOf His face,\nThroughout eternity."
