    "lyrics": "Have you any room for Jesus,\nHe who bore your load of sin?\nAs He knocks and asks admission,\nSinner, will you let Him in?\n\nCHORUS:\nRoom for Jesus, King of glory;\nHasten now, His word obey;\nSwing the heart’s door widely open;\nBid Him enter while you may.\n\nRoom for pleasure, room for business;\nBut for Christ, the Crucified,\nNot a place that He can enter,\nIn the heart for which He died?\n\nHave you any time for Jesus,\nAs in grace He calls again?\nOh, “today” is “time accepted,”\n“Tomorrow” you may call in vain.\n\nRoom and time now give to Jesus;\nSoon will pass God’s day of grace;\nSoon thy heart be cold and silent,\nAnd thy Savior’s pleadings cease."
