    "lyrics": "O Holy Night\nThe stars are brightly shining,\nIt is the night\nOf the dear Saviour's birth,\nLong lay the world\nIn sin and error pining,\nTill He appeared\nAnd the soul felt its worth,\nA thrill of Hope\nThe weary world rejoices,\nFor yonder breaks\nA new and glorious morn,\nFall on your knees,\nO hear the Angel voices,\nO Night Divine,\nO Night when Christ was\nborn,\nO Night, O Holy Night,\nO Night Divine.\n\nLed by the light\nOf faith serenely beaming,\nWith glowing hearts\nBy His cradle we stand,\nSo led by light\nOf a star sweetly gleaming,\nHere came the wise men\nFrom Orient land,\nThe King of kings\nLay Thus in lowly manger,\nIn all our trials\nBorn to be our friend\nHe knows our need,\nTo our weakness is no\nstranger,\nBehold your King,\nBefore Him lowly bend,\nBehold your King,\nBefore Him lowly bend.\n\nTruly He taught us\nTo love one another,\nHis law is love\nAnd His gospel is peace,\nChains shall He break,\nFor slave is our brother,\nAnd in His name\nAll oppression shall cease,\nSweet hymns of joy\nIn grateful chorus raise we,\nLet all within us\nPraise His Holy Name,\nChrist is the Lore,\nOh praise His name forever,\nHis power and glory\nEvermore proclaim\nHis power and glory,\nEvermore proclaim"
