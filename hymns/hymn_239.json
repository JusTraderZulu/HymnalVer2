    "lyrics": "Awake, my soul and with the sun\nThy daily stage of duty run;\nShake off dull sloth,\nAnd joyful rise\nTo pay Thy morning sacrifice.\n\nRedeem Thy mis-spent time that's past\nAnd live this day as if Thy last:\nimprove Thy talent with due care;\nFor the great day Thy self prepare.\n\nLet all Thy converse be sincere,\nThy conscience as the noonday clear;\nThink how all-seeing God Thy ways\nAnd all Thy secret thoughts surveys.\n\nWake, and lift up Thyself, my heart,\nAnd with the Angels bear Thy part,\nWho all night long unwearied sing\nHigh praise to the Eternal King.\n\nGlory to Thee who safe hast kept,\nAnd hast refresh'd me whilst I slept;\nGrant, Lord,\nWhen l from death shall wake,\nI may of endless light partake.\n\nLord, I my vows to Thee renew,\nScatter my sins as morning dew;\nGuard my first springs\nOf thought and will,\nAnd with Thyself my spirit fill.\n\nDirect, control, suggest, this day,\nAll I design, or do, or say;\nThat all my powers,\nWith all their might,\nIn Thy sole glory may unite."
