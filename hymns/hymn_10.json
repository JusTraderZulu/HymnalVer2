  "lyrics": "Peace be on this house bestowed\nPeace on all that here reside\nLet the unknown peace of God\nWith the manner of peace abide.\n\nLet Thy Spirit now come down\nLet Thy blessing now take place\nSon of peace receive Thy crown\nFullness of Thy gospel grace.\n\nChrist my master and my God\nLet me die for honour be\nOh be mindful of these words\nVisit them and visit me.\n\nTo this house and all therein\nNow let Thy salvation come\nSave our soul from inbred sin\nMake us Thine eternal home.\n\nLet us never never rest\nTill Thy promise is fulfilled\nTill we are of Thee possessed\nPardon sanctified and sealed.\n\nTill we all in love renew\nFind the pearl that Adam lost\nTemple of the living God\nFather Son and Holy Ghost."
