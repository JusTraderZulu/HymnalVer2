    "lyrics": "There is a name I love to hear,\nI love to sing its worth;\nIt sounds like music in my ear,\nThe sweetest name on Earth.\n\nCHORUS:\nOh, how I love Jesus,\nOh, how I love Jesus,\nOh, how I love Jesus,\nBecause He first loved me.\n\nIt tells me of a Saviour's love,\nWho died to set me free;\nIt tells me of His precious blood,\nThe sinner's perfect plea.\n\nIt tells me what my Father hath,\nIn store for every day;\nAnd though I tread a darksome path,\nYields sunshine all the way.\n\nIt tells of One whose loving heart\nCan feel my deepest woe,\nWho in each sorrow bears a part\nThat none can bear below."
