    "lyrics": "AT the Cross her station keeping\nStood the mournful Mother weeping,\nWhere He hung, the dying Lord;\nFor her soul of joy bereaved,\nBow'd with anguish, deeply grieved,\nFelt the sharp and piercing sword.\n\nOh, how sad and sore distressed\nNow was she, that Mother blessed\nOf the sole-begotten One;\nDeep the woe of her affliction,\nWhen she saw the Crucifixion\nOf her ever-glorious Son.\n\nWho, on Christ's dear Mother gazing\nPierced by anguish so amazing,\nBorn of woman, would not weep?\nWho, on Christ's dear Mother\nThinking\nSuch a cup of sorrow drinking,\nWould not share her sorrow deep?\n\nFor His people's sins chastised,\nShe beheld her Son despised,\nScourged, and crown'd with thorns entwined;\nSaw Him then from judgment taken,\nAnd in death by all forsaken,\nTill His Spirit He resign'd.\n\nJesu, may her deep devotion\nStir in me the same emotion,\nFount of love, Redeemer kind,\nThat my heart fresh ardour gaining,\nAnd a purer love attaining,\nMay with Thee acceptance find."
