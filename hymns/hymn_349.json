    "lyrics": "Here, O my Lord, I see Thee face to face\nHere would I touch and handle things unseen,\nHere grasp with firmer hand the Eternal Grace,\nAnd all my helplessness upon Thee lean.\n\nHere would I feed upon the bread of God,\nHere drink with Thee the royal wine of Heaven,\nHere would I lay aside each Earthly load,\nHere taste afresh the calm of sin forgiven.\n\nThis is the hour of banquet and of song\nThis is the Heavenly table spread for me,\nHere let me feast and feasting still prolong\nThe hallowed hour of fellowship with Thee.\n\nPART II\n\nToo soon we rise the symbols disappear\nThe feast, though not the love is past and gone,\nThe bread and wine remove but Thou art here,\nNearer than ever still my shield and sun.\n\nI have no help but Thine, nor do I need,\nAnother arm save Thine to lean upon,\nIt is enough, my Lord enough indeed,\nMy strength is in Thy might alone.\n\nFeast after feast\nThus comes and passes by,\nYet passing, points\nTo the glad feast above.\nGiving sweet foretaste\nOf the festal joy,\nThe lamb's Great bridal\nFeast of bliss and love."
