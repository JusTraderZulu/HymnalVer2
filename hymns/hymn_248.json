    "lyrics": "Talk with us, Lord, Thyself reveal,\nWhile here o'er Earth we rove;\nSpeak to our hearts, and let us feel\nThe kindling of Thy love.\n\nWith Thee conversing, we forget\nAll time, and toil, and care;\nLabour is rest, and pain is sweet\nIf Thou, my God, art here.\n\nHere then, my God, vouchsafe to stay,\nAnd bid my heart rejoice;\nMy bounding heart shall own Thy sway,\nAnd echo to Thy voice.\n\nThou callest me to seek Thy face;\n'tis all I wish to seek;\nTo attend the whispers of Thy grace,\nAnd hear Thee only speak.\n\nLet this my every hour employ,\nTill I Thy glory see:\nEnter into my Master's joy,\nAnd find my Heaven in Thee."
