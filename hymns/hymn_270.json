    "lyrics": "O weary heart,\nThere is a home,\nBeyond the reach of\nToil and care,\nA home where changes\nNever come,\nWho would not fain\nBe resting there?\n\nCHORUS:\nOh wait, meekly wait\nAnd murmur not,\nOh wait, meekly wait,\nAnd murmur not,\nOh wait, oh wait,\nOh wait, and murmur not!\n\nYet when bowed down\nBeneath the load,\nBy Heaven allowed,\nThine Earthly lot,\nLook up! Thou'lt reach\nThat blest abode,\nWait, meekly wait,\nAnd murmur not.\n\nlf in thy path\nSome thorns are found,\nOh, think who bore them\nOn His brow;\nIf grief thy sorrowing\nHeart has found,\nIt reached a Holier\nThan Thou.\n\nToil on, nor deem,\nThough sore it be,\nOne sigh unheard,\nOne prayer forgot,\nA day of rest\nWill dawn for thee,\nWait, meekly wait,\nAnd murmur not!"
