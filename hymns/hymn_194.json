    "lyrics": "1\nO for a heart to praise my God,\na heart from sin set free;\na heart that's sprinkled with the blood\nso freely shed for me:\n\n2\nA heart resigned, submissive, meek,\nmy great Redeemer's throne;\nwhere only Christ is heard to speak,\nwhere Jesus reigns alone:\n\n3\nA humble, lowly, contrite heart,\nbelieving, true, and clean,\nwhich neither life nor death can part\nfrom him that dwells within:\n\n4\nA heart in every thought renewed,\nand full of love divine;\nperfect and right and pure and good \na copy, Lord, of thine.\n\n5\nThy nature, gracious Lord, impart\ncome quickly from above;\nwrite thy new name upon my heart,\nthy new best name of Love."
