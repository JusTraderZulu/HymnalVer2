    "lyrics": "We sing the praise of Him who died,\nOf Him who died upon the cross;\nThe sinner's hope let men deride,\nFor this we count the world but loss.\n\nInscribed upon the cross we see\nIn shining letters; God is love.\nHe bears our sins upon the tree:\nHe brings us mercy from above.\n\nThe Cross-it takes our guilt away;\nIt holds the fainting Spirit up;\nIt cheers with hope the gloomy day,\nAnd sweetens every bitter cup.\n\nIt makes the coward spirit brave,\nAnd nerves the feeble arm for fight;\nIt takes its terror from the grave,\nAnd gilds the bed of death with light.\n\nThe balm of life, the cure of woe,\nThe measure and the pledge of love,\nThe sinner's refuge here below,\nThe Angels' theme in Heav'n above.\n\nTo Christ, who won for sinner's grace\nBy bitter grief and anguish sore,\nBe praise from all the ransom'd race\nFor ever and for evermore."
