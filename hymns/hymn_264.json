    "lyrics": "Be Thou my Guardian and my Guide,\nAnd hear me when I call;\nLet not my slippery\nFootstep slide,\nAnd hold me lest I fall.\n\nThe world, the flesh,\nAnd Satan dwell\nAround the path I tread;\nO save me from the snares of hell,\nThou quickener of the dead.\n\nAnd if I tempted am to sin,\nAnd outward things are strong,\nDo Thou, O Lord,\nKeep watch within\nAnd save my soul from wrong.\n\nStill let me ever watch and pray,\nAnd feel that I am frail;\nThat if the tempter cross my way,\nYet He may not prevail."
