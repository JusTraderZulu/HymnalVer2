    "lyrics": "1. A few more years shall roll,\nA few more seasons come,\nAnd we shall be with those that rest\nAsleep within the tomb.\n\nCHORUS:\nThee, Oh my Lord, prepare,\nMy soul for that great day;\nOh, wash me in Thy precious blood,\nAnd take my sins away.\n\n2. A few more suns shall set\nO'er these dark hills of time,\nAnd we shall be where suns are not,\nA far serener clime.\n\n3. A few more storms shall beat\nOn this wild, rocky shore,\nAnd we shall be where tempests cease,\nAnd surges swell no more.\n\n4. A few more struggles here,\nA few more partings o'er,\nA few more toils, a few more tears,\nAnd we shall weep no more.\n\n5. 'Tis but a little while,\nAnd He shall come again,\nWho died that we might live who lives,\nThat we with Him may reign."
