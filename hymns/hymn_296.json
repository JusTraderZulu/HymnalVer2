He is coming, the man of sorrows\nNow exalted on high,\nHe is coming with loud Hosannas,\nIn the clouds of the sky.\n\nCHORUS:\nHallelujah, Hallelujah,\nHe is coming again\nAnd with joy\nWe will gather round Him,\nAt His coming to reign.\n\n2. He is coming, our loving Saviour,\nBlessed Lamb that was slain,\nIn the glory of God the Father,\nOn the Earth He shall reign.\n\n3. He is coming, our Lord and Master,\nOur redeemer and king,\nWe shall see Him in all His beauty,\nAnd His praise we shall sing.\n\n4. He shall gather His chosen people,\nWho are called by His name,\nAnd the ransomed of every nation;\nFor His own He shall claim."
