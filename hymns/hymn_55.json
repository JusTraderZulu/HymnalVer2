    "lyrics": "I have seen the lightning flashing,\nAnd heard the thunder roll,\nI have felt sin's breakers dashing,\nTrying to conquer my soul;\nI have heard the voice of my Savior,\nTelling me still to fight on,\nHe promised never to leave me,\nNever to leave me alone.\n\nCHORUS:\nNo, never alone, (repeat)\nNo, never alone,\nHe promised never to leave me,\nNever to leave me alone.\n\nThe world's fierce winds are blowing,\nTemptations sharp and keen,\nI feel a peace in knowing,\nMy Savior stands between;\nHe stands to shield me from danger,\nWhen earthly friends are gone,\nHe promised never to leave me,\nNever to leave me alone.\n\nWhen in affliction's valley,\nI'm treading the road of care,\nMy Savior helps me to carry\nMy cross when heavy to bear;\nMy feet entangled with briars,\nReady to cast me down,\nMy Savior whispers His promise,\nNever will leave me alone.\n\nHe died for me on the mountain,\nFor me they pierced His side,\nFor me He opened the fountain,\nThe crimson cleansing tide;\nFor me He is waiting in glory,\nSeated upon His throne,\nHe promised never to leave me,\nNever to leave me alone."
