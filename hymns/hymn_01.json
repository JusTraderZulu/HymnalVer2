When we walk with the Lord\nIn the light of His word,\nWhat a Glory\nHe sheds on our way,\nWhile we do His good will,\nHe abides with us still,\nAnd with all who will\nTrust and obey\n\nCHORUS:\nTrust and obey,\nFor there is\nNo other way\nTo be happy in Jesus\nBut to trust and obey\n\n2. Not a shadow can rise,\nNot a cloud in the skies,\nBut His smiles\nQuickly drives it away,\nNot a doubt nor a fear,\nNot a sigh nor a tear,\nCan abide while we\nTrust and obey\n\n3. Not a burden we bear,\nNot a sorrow we share,\nBut our toil\nHe doth richly repay,\nNot a grief nor a loss\nNot a frown nor a cross\nBut is blest if we\nTrust and obey.\n\n4. But we never can prove,\nThe delights of His love,\nUntil all on the altar we lay,\nFor the favour He shows,\nAnd the joy He bestows,\nAre for them who will\nTrust and obey.\n\n5. Then in fellowship sweet,'\nWe will sit at His feet,\nOr we'll walk\nBy His side in the way,\nWhat He says we will do,\nWhere He sends we will go,\nNever fear, only trust and obey."
