    "lyrics": "Lift up your heads, ye gates of brass,\nYe bars of iron yield;\nAnd let the King of Glory pass;\nThe Cross is in the field.\n\nThat banner, brighter than the star\nThat leads the train of night,\nShines on the march, and guides from far\nHis servants to the fight.\n\nA holy war those servants wage;\nIn that mysterious strife,\nThe powers of Heav'n and hell engage\nFor more than death or life.\n\nYe armies of the living God,\nSworn of Christ's host,\nWhere hallowed footsteps never trod,\nTake your appointed post.\n\nThough few and small and weak your bands,\nStrong in your Captain's strength,\nGo to the conquest of all lands:\nAll must be His at length.\n\nThe spoils at His victorious Feet\nYou shall rejoice to lay,\nAnd lay yourselves as trophies meet,\nIn His great judgment day.\n\nThen fear not, faint not, halt not now;\nIn Jesus Name be strong!\nTo Him shall all the nations bow,\nAnd sing the triumph song.\n\nUplifted are the gates of brass,\nThe bars of iron yield;\nBehold the King of Glory pass;\nThe Cross hath won the field."
