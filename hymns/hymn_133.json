    "lyrics": "1. O let him, whose sorrow\nNo relief can find,\nTrust in God, and borrow\nEase for heart and mind.\n\n2. Where the mourner weeping\nSheds the secret tear,\nGod His watch is keeping,\nThough none else is near.\n\n3. God will never leave thee,\nAll thy wants He knows,\nFeels the pains that grieve thee,\nSees thy cares and woes.\n\n4. Raise thine eyes to heaven\nWhen thy spirits quail,\nWhen, by tempests driven,\nHeart and courage fail.\n\n5. When thy gracious Saviour\nIn the realms above\nCrowns thee with His favor,\nFills thee with His love.\n\n6. All thy woe and sadness,\nIn this world below,\nBalance not the gladness\nThou in heaven shalt know."
