  "lyrics": "1. Revive thy work, O Lord,\nThy mighty arm make bare;\nSpeak with the voice that wakes the dead,\nAnd make Thy people hear.\n\n2. Revive thy work, O Lord,\nDisturb this sleep of death;\nQuicken the smould'ring embers now\nBy Thine almighty breath.\n\n3. Revive thy work, O Lord,\nCreate soul-thirst for Thee;\nAnd hung'ring for the Bread of Life\nO may our spirits be.\n\n4. Revive thy work, O Lord,\nExalt Thy precious name;\nAnd, by the Holy Ghost, our love\nFor Thee and Thine inflame.\n\n5. Revive thy work, O Lord,\nGive Pentecostal show'rs;\nThe glory shall be all Thine own,\nThe blessing, Lord, be ours."
