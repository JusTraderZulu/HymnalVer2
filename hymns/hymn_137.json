Mine eyes have seen\nThe glory of the coming\nOf the Lord;\nHe is trampling out\nThe vintage where the grapes\nOf wrath are stored;\nHe hath loosed\nThe fateful lightning\nOf His terrible swift sword;\nHis truth is marching on.\n\nChorus:\nGlory, glory, hallelujah!\nGlory, glory, hallelujah!\nGlory, glory, hallelujah!\nHis truth is marching on.\n\n2. I have seen Him in the watchfires\nOf a hundred circling camps,\nThey have builded Him an altar\nIn the evening dews and damps;\nI can read His righteous sentence\nBy the dim and flaring lamps;\nHis day is marching on.\n\n3. He has sounded forth the trumpet\nThat shall never call retreat;\nHe is sifting out\nThe hearts of men\nBefore His judgment seat;\nOh, be swift, my soul, to answer\nHim; be jubilant, my feet!\nOur God is marching on.\n\n4. In the beauty of the lilies\nChrist was born across the sea,\nWith a glory in His bosom\nThat transfigures you and me;\nAs He died to make men holy,\nLet us die to make men free,\nWhile God is marching on."
