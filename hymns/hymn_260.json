    "lyrics": "O for a faith\nThat will not shrink\nThough press'd by many a foe;\nThat will not tremble\nOn the brink\nOf poverty or woe;\n\nThat will not murmur\nNor complain\nBeneath the chastening rod;\nBut in the hour\nOf grief or pain\nCan lean upon its God;\n\nA faith that shines\nMore bright and clear\nWhen tempests rage without;\nThat when in danger knows no fear,\nIn darkness feels no doubt;\n\nA faith that keeps\nThe narrow way,\nTill life's last spark is fled,\nAnd with a pure and Heavenly ray\nLights up the dying bed.\n\nLord, give me such\nA faith as this,\nAnd then, whate'er may come,\nI taste e'en now\nThe hallow'd bliss\nOf an Eternal home."
