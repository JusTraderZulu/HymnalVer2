Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.\nOur Father Our Father Who art in Heaven Hallowed by thy name thy kingdom come Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom And the power, and the glory, forever and ever Amen"
