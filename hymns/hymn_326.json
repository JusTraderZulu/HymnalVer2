    "lyrics": "I'm satisfied with just\nAnother cottage below\nA little silver\nAnd a little gold,\nBut in that city\nWhere the ransomed will shine,\nI want a gold one\nThat's silver lined.\n\nCHORUS:\nI've got a mansion\nJust over the hilltop,\nIn that bright land\nWhere we'll never grow old,\nAn someday yonder,\nWe will never more wander;\nBut walk on streets\nThat are purest gold\n\nTho’ often tempted,\nTormented and tested\nAnd like the prophet\nMy pillow a stone,\nAnd tho’ I find here\nNo permanent dwelling,\nI know He’ll give me a\nMansion of my own\n\nDon’t think me poor\nOr deserted, or lonely,\nI’m not discouraged,\nI’m Heaven bound,\nI’m just a pilgrim\nIn search of that city\nI want a mansion\nA harp and a crown."
