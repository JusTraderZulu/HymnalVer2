  "lyrics": "Through all the changing scenes of life,\nIn trouble and in joy,\nThe praises of my God shall still\nMy heart and tongue employ.\n\nO magnify the Lord with me,\nWith me exalt His name;\nWhen in distress to Him I called,\nHe to my rescue came.\n\nThe hosts of God encamp around\nThe dwellings of the just;\nDeliverance He affords to all\nWho on His succor trust.\n\nO make but trial of His love,\nExperience will decide\nHow blessed are they, and only they,\nWho in His truth confide.\n\nFear Him, ye saints, and you will then\nHave nothing else to fear;\nMake you His service your delight,\nYour wants shall be His care.\n\nTo Father, Word, and Holy Ghost,\nThe God whom we adore,\nBe glory as it was, is now\nAnd shall be evermore."
