Holy Trinity.\n\nJesu evermore adored,\nAs we claim Thy promised word,\nGather'd in Thy Name, O Lord,\nHear us, we beseech Thee.\n\nFor Thy Church so dear to Thee,\nThat she may for ever be\nKept in peace and unity,\nWe beseech Thee, Jesu.\n\nFor the rulers of our land,\nThat they may at Thy command\nRight promote and wrong withstand,\nWe beseech Thee, Jesu.\n\nFor Thy priests in every place,\nThat relying on Thy grace\nThey with patience run their race,\nWe beseech Thee, Jesu.\n\nAll our loved ones we commend,\nLord, to Thee, man's truest Friend,\nGuard and guide them to the end,\nWe beseech Thee, Jesu.\n\nSome on beds of sickness lie,\nSome in want and hunger cry;\nLord, their every need supply,\nWe beseech Thee, Jesu.\n\nSome are lonely, some are sad,\nSome have lost the joy they had;\nWith true comfort make them glad,\nWe beseech Thee, Jesu.\n\nSome have fallen from Thy grace,\nWearied in their heav'nward race;\nMay they rise and seek Thy face,\nWe beseech Thee, Jesu.\n\nSome are sunk in deadly sin\nWith no spark of love within,\nIn their souls Thy work begin,\nWe beseech Thee, Jesu.\n\nThat whoever now doth lie\nIn his mortal agony,\nTo the last may feel Thee nigh,\nWe beseech Thee, Jesu."
