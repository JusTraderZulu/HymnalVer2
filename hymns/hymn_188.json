    "lyrics": "1. All praise to Him who reigns above,\nIn majesty supreme,\nWho gave His Son for man to die,\nThat He might man redeem.\n\nCHORUS:\nBlessed be the name, blessed be the name,\nBlessed be the name of the Lord;\nBlessed be the name, blessed be the name,\nBlessed be the name of the Lord.\n\n2. His name above all names shall stand,\nExalted more and more,\nAt God the Father’s own right hand,\nWhere angel hosts adore.\n\n3. His name shall be the Counsellor,\nThe mighty Prince of Peace;\nOf all Earth’s kingdoms conqueror\nWhose reign shall never cease.\n\n4. Redeemer, Saviour, Friend of man,\nOnce ruined by the fall,\nThou hast devised salvation’s plan,\nFor Thou hast died for all."
