    "lyrics": "Songs of praise the Angels sang,\nHeaven with Alleluias rang,\nWhen creation was begun,\nWhen God spake and it was done.\n\nSongs of praise awoke the morn\nWhen the Prince of peace was born;\nSongs of praise arose when He\nCaptive led captivity.\n\nHeav'n and Earth must pass away,\nSongs of praise shall crown that day;\nGod will make new Heavens and Earth,\nSongs of praise shall hail their birth.\n\nAnd will man alone be dumb\nTill that glorious Kingdom come?\nNo, the Church delights to raise\nPsalms and hymns and songs of praise.\n\nSaints below with heart and voice,\nStill in songs of praise rejoice;\nLearning here, by faith and love,\nSongs of praise to sing above.\n\nHymns of glory songs of praise,\nFather, unto Thee we raise,\nJesu, glory unto Thee,\nWith the Spirit, ever be."
