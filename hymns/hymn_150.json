    "lyrics": "1\nDown in the valley with my Savior I will go,\nWhere the flowâ€™rs are blooming and the sweet waters flow;\nEverywhere He leads me I will follow, follow on,\nWalking in His footsteps till the crown be won.\n\nChorus:\nFollow! follow! I will follow Jesus!\nAnywhere, everywhere, I will follow on!\nFollow! follow! I will follow Jesus!\nEverywhere He leads me I will follow on!\n\n2\nDown in the valley with my Savior I will go,\nWhere the storms are sweeping and the dark waters flow;\nWith His hand to lead me I will never, never fear,\nDanger cannot fright me if my Lord is near.\n\n3\nDown in the valley, or upon the mountain steep,\nClose beside my Savior will my soul ever keep;\nHe will lead me safely in the path that He has trod,\nUp to where they gather on the hills of God."
