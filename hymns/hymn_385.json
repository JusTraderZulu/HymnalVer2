    "lyrics": "Within the churchyard, side by side,\nAre many long low graves;\nAnd some have stones set over them,\nOn some the green grass waves.\n\nFully many a little Christian child.\nWoman, and man, lies there;\nAnd we pass near them every time\nWhen we go in to prayer.\n\nThey cannot hear our fool steps come,\nThey do not see us pass;\nThey cannot feel the warm bright sun\nThat shines upon the grass.\n\nThey do not hear when the great bell\nls ringing overhead; they cannot rise\nAnd come to Church\nWith us, for they are dead.\n\nBut we believe a day shall come\nWhen all the dead will rise,\nWhen they who sleep\nDown in the grave\nWill open again their eyes.\n\nFor Christ our Lord was buried once,\nHe died and rose again,\nHe conquer'd death, he left the grave;\nAnd so will Christian men.\n\nSo when the friends\nWe love the best\nLie in their churchyard bed,\nWe must not cry too bitterly\nOver the happy dead;\n\nBecause, for our dear Saviour's sake,\nOur sins are all forgiven;\nAnd Christians only fall asleep\nTo awake again in Heaven."
