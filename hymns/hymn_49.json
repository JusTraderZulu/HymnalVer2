  "lyrics": "O God of Bethel, by whose hand\nThy people still are fed;\nWho through this weary pilgrimage\nHast all our fathers led:\n\nOur vows, our prayers, we now present\nBefore Thy throne of grace;\nGod of our fathers, be the God\nOf their succeeding race.\n\nThrough each perplexing path of life\nOur wandering footsteps guide;\nGive us each day our daily bread,\nAnd raiment fit provide.\n\nO spread Thy covering wings around,\nTill all our wanderings cease,\nAnd at our Fatherâ€™s loved abode\nOur souls arrive in peace.\n\nSuch blessings from Thy gracious hand\nOur humble prayers implore;\nAnd Thou shalt be our chosen God,\nAnd portion evermore. Amen."
