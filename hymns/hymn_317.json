    "lyrics": "On Jordan's stormy banks I stand,\nAnd cast a wistful eye\nTo Canaan's fair and happy land\nWhere my possessions lie.\n\nCHORUS:\nWe will rest in the fair and happy land,\nJust across on the evergreen shore,\nSing the song of Moses and the Lamb, by and by\nAnd dwell with Jesus evermore.\n\nO'er all those wide extended plains,\nShines one eternal day,\nThere God the Son forever reigns,\nAnd scatters night away.\n\nWhen shall I reach that happy place\nAnd be forever blest?\nWhen shall I see my Father's face\nAnd in His bosom rest?\n\nFilled with delight, my raptured soul,\nWould here no longer stay,\nThough Jordan's waves around me roll,\nFearless I'd launch away."
