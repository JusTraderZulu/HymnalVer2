    "lyrics": "1. In the great triumphant morning,\nWhen we hear the bridegroom cry\nAnd the dead in Christ shall rise,\nWe'll be changed to life immortal,\nIn the twinkling of an eye,\nAnd meet Jesus in the skies.\n\nCHORUS:\nWe shall all rise to meet Him,\nWe shall all go to greet Him;\nIn the morning when the dead in Christ shall rise,\nWe shall all rise to meet Him,\nWe shall all go to greet Him,\nAnd shall have the marriage supper in the skies.\n\n2. In the great triumphant morning,\nWhat a happy time 'twill be,\nWhen the dead in Christ shall rise,\nWhen the Lord descends in glory,\nSets His waiting children free,\nAnd we meet Him in the skies.\n\n3. In the great triumphant morning,\nWhen the harvest is complete\nAnd the dead in Christ shall rise,\nWe'll be crowned with life immortal,\nChrist and all the loved ones meet,\nIn the rapture in the skies.\n\n4. In the great triumphant morning,\nAll the kingdoms we'll possess,\nThen the dead in Christ shall rise,\nReign as kings and priests eternal,\nUnder Christ forever blest,\nAfter meeting in the skies."
