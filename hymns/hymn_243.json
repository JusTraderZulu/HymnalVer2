  "lyrics": "Spirit Divine, attend our prayers\nAnd make our hearts Thy home,\nDescend with all Thy gracious powers,\nOh come, great Spirit, come.\n\nCome as the light-to us reveal\nOur emptiness and woe,\nAnd lead us in those paths of life,\nWhere all the righteous go.\n\nCome as the fire and purge our hearts,\nLike sacrificial flame,\nLet our whole soul and offering be,\nTo our Redeemer's name.\n\nCome as the dew and sweetly bless,\nThis consecrated hour,\nMay barrenness rejoice to own,\nThy fertilizing power.\n\nCome as the dove and spread Thy wings,\nThe wings of peaceful love,\nAnd let Thy Church on Earth become,\nBlest as the church above.\n\nCome as the wind with rushing sound,\nAnd Pentecostal grace\nThat all of women born may see\nThe glory of Thy face"
