    "lyrics": "I am so glad that our Father in Heaven,\nTells of His love in the book He has given,\nWonderful things in the Bible I see,\nThis is the dearest, that Jesus loves me.\n\nCHORUS:\nI am so glad that Jesus loves me,\nJesus loves me, Jesus loves me,\nI am so glad that Jesus loves me,\nJesus loves even me.\n\nThough I forget Him and wander away,\nStill He doth love me wherever I stray;\nBack to His dear loving arms do I flee,\nWhen I remember that Jesus loves me.\n\nOh, if there's only one song I can sing,\nWhen in His beauty I see the great King,\nThis shall my song in eternity be,\n\"Oh, what a wonder that Jesus loves me!\"\n\nJesus loves me, and I know I love Him:\nLove brought Him down my poor soul to redeem:\nYes, it was love made Him die on the tree:\nOh, I am certain that Jesus loves me!\n\nIf one should ask of me, how can I tell?\nGlory to Jesus, I know very well!\nGod's Holy Spirit with mine doth agree,\nConstantly witnessing Jesus loves me.\n\nIn this assurance I find sweetest rest,\nTrusting in Jesus, I know I am blessed,\nSatan, dismayed, from my soul now doth flee,\nWhen I just tell him that Jesus loves me."
