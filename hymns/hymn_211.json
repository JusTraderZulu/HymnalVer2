  "lyrics": "1\nBlessed assurance, Jesus is mine!\nOh, what a foretaste of glory divine!\nHeir of salvation, purchase of God,\nborn of his Spirit, washed in his blood.\n\nChorus:\nThis is my story, this is my song,\npraising my Savior all the day long.\nThis is my story, this is my song,\npraising my Savior all the day long.\n\n2\nPerfect communion, perfect delight,\nvisions of rapture now burst on my sight.\nAngels descending bring from above\nechoes of mercy, whispers of love.\n\n3\nPerfect submission, all is at rest.\nI in my Savior am happy and blessâ€™d,\nwatching and waiting, looking above,\nfilled with his goodness, lost in his love."
