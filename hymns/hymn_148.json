No, not one!\n\nChorus:\nJesus knows all about our struggles,\nHe will guide till the day is done;\nThere’s not a friend like the lowly Jesus,\nNo, not one! No, not one!\n\n2\nNo friend like Him is so high and holy,\nNo, not one! No, not one!\nAnd yet no friend is so meek and lowly,\nNo, not one! No, not one!\n\n3\nThere’s not an hour that He is not near us,\nNo, not one! No, not one!\nNo night so dark but His love can cheer us,\nNo, not one! No, not one!\n\n4\nDid ever saint find this Friend forsake him?\nNo, not one! No, not one!\nOr sinner find that He would not take him?\nNo, not one! No, not one!\n\n5\nWas e’er a gift like the Savior given?\nNo, not one! No, not one!\nWill He refuse us a home in heaven?\nNo, not one! No, not one!"
