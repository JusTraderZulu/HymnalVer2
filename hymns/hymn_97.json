    "lyrics": "A friend of Jesus, oh, what bliss,\nThat one so weak as I\nShould ever have a friend like this\nTo lead me to the sky.\n\nCHORUS:\nFriendship with Jesus,\nFellowship divine,\nOh, what blessed sweet communion,\nJesus is a friend of mine.\n\nA friend when other friendships cease,\nA friend when others fail;\nA friend who gives me joy and peace,\nA friend who will prevail.\n\nA friend to lead me in the dark,\nA friend who knows the way;\nA friend to steer my weak, frail bark,\nA friend my debts to pay.\n\nA friend when sickness lays me low,\nA friend when death draws near;\nA friend as thro' the vale I go,\nA friend to help and cheer.\n\nA friend when life's rough voyage is o'er,\nA friend when death is past;\nA friend to greet on Heaven's shore,\nA friend when home at last."
