    "lyrics": "1. Once my soul was astray from the heavenly way,\nAnd was wretched and vile as could be;\nBut my Saviour above gave me peace, joy and love,\nWhen He reach’d down His hand for me.\n\nCHORUS:\nWhen He reached down His hand for me,\nWhen He reach’d down His hand for me;\nI was lost and undone, without God or His Son,\nWhen He reached down His hand for me.\n\n2. I was nearing despair, when He came to me there,\nAnd He showed me that I could be free;\nThen He lifted my feet, gave me glory complete,\nWhen He reach’d down His hand for me.\n\n3. How my heart doth rejoice since I made Him my choice,\nFrom the tempest to Him now I flee;\nNow I lean on His arm, I’m secure from all harm,\nSince He reach’d down His hand for me.\n\n4. Since the Lord gave me peace, heav’nly joys never cease,\nLord, I give all my life unto Thee;\nGuide my feet, hold my hand, grant with Thee I may stand,\nFor You reach’d down Your hand for me."
