My Jesus, I love Thee,\nI know Thou art mine,\nFor Thee all the follies\nOf sin I resign;\nMy gracious Redeemer\nMy Saviour art Thou;\nlf ever I loved Thee,\nMy Jesus, 'tis now.\n\n2. I love Thee because\nThou hast first loved me,\nAnd purchased my pardon\nOn Calvary's tree;\nI love Thee for wearing\nThe thorns on Thy brow;\nlf ever I loved Thee,\nMy Jesus 'tis now.\n\n3. I'll love Thee in life,\nI will love Thee in death,\nAnd praise Thee as long\nAs Thou lendest me breath;\nAnd say when the death dew\nLies cold on my brow,\nlf ever I loved Thee,\nMy Jesus, 'tis now.\n\n4. In mansions of glory\nAnd endless delight\nl'll ever adore Thee\nIn Heaven so bright;\nl'll sing with the glittering\nCrown on my brow,\nlf ever I loved Thee,\nMy Jesus, 'tis now."
