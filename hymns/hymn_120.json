  "lyrics": "Sweet hour of prayer,\nSweet hour of prayer,\nThat calls me from\nA world of care, and bids me at\nMy Father's throne\nMake all my wants,\nAnd wishes known; In seasons of\nDistress and grief,\nMy soul has often found relief,\nAnd oft escaped\nThe tempter's snare,\nBy Thy return,\nSweet hour of prayer.\n\nSweet hour of prayer,\nSweet hour of prayer,\nThy wings shall my petition bear\nTo Him whose truth\nAnd faithfulness\nEngage the waiting soul to bless;\nAnd since He bids me\nSeek His face,\nBelieve His word\nAnd trust His grace,\nI'll cast on Him\nMy every care,\nAnd wait for Thee,\nSweet hour of prayer.\n\nSweet hour of prayer,\nSweet hour of prayer,\nMay I Thy consolation share,\nTill, from Mount Pisgah's\nLofty height, I view my home,\nAnd take my flight:\nThis robe of flesh\nI'll drop, and rise,\nTo seize the everlasting prize;\nAnd shout,\nWhile passing through the air,\nFarewell, farewell,\nSweet hour of prayer!"
