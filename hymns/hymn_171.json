Lord of life,\nshield us through our earthly strife;\nthou the Life, the Truth, the Way,\nguide us to the realms of day.\n\n3\nThine for ever! O how blest\nthey who find in thee their rest!\nSaviour, guardian, heavenly friend,\nO defend us to the end.\n\n4\nThine for ever! Shepherd, keep\nus thy frail and trembling sheep;\nsafe alone beneath thy care,\nlet us all thy goodness share.\n\n5\nThine for ever! Thou our guide,\nall our wants by thee supplied,\nall our sins by thee forgiven,\nlead us, Lord, from earth to heaven."
