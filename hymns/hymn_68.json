    "lyrics": "Lead us, Heavenly Father, lead us\nO'er the world's tempestuous sea;\nGuide us, guard us,\nKeep us, feed us,\nFor we have no help but Thee;\nYet possessing every blessing,\nIf our God our Father be.\n\nSaviour, breathe\nForgiveness o'er us,\nAll our weakness Thou dost know;\nThou didst tread\nThe Earth before us\nThou didst feel its keenest woe,\nLone and dreary, faint and weary\nThrough the desert Thou didst go.\n\nSpirit of our God, descending,\nFill our hearts with Heavenly joy,\nLove with every feeling blending,\nPleasures that can never cloy;\nThus provided, pardoned, guided,\nNothing can our peace destroy."
