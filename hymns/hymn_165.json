    "lyrics": "1\nA charge to keep I have,\na God to glorify,\na never-dying soul to save,\nand fit it for the sky.\n\n2\nTo serve the present age,\nmy calling to fulfill,\nO may it all my pow'rs engage\nto do my Master's will!\n\n3\nArm me with watchful care\nas in Thy sight to live,\nand now Thy servant, Lord, prepare\na strict account to give!\n\n4\nHelp me to watch and pray,\nand still on Thee rely,\nO let me not my trust betray,\nbut press to realms on high."
