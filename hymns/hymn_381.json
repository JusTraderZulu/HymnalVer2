    "lyrics": "1. Come, Ye thankful people, come\nRaise the song of harvest home:\nAll is safely gathered in\nEre the winter storms begin.\nGod, our Maker, doth provide\nFor our wants to be supplied:\nCome to God's own temple come\nRaise the song of harvest home.\n\n2. All this world is God's own field,\nFruit unto His praise to yield:\nWheat and tares therein are sown,\nUnto joy or sorrow grown.\nRipening with a wondrous power\nTill the final harvest hour,\nGrant, O Lord of life, that we\nHoly grain and pure may be.\n\n3. For we know that Thou wilt come\nAnd wilt take Thy people home:\nFrom Thy field wilt purge away\nAll that doth offend, that day\nAnd thine Angels charge at last,\nIn the fire the tares to cast,\nBut the fruitful ears to store,\nIn Thy garner evermore.\n\n4. Come then, Lord of mercy, come\nBid us sign Thy harvest home:\nLet Thy Saints be gather'd in,\nFree from sorrow free from sin;\nAll upon the golden floor\nPraising Thee for evermore;\nCome, with all Thine Angels, come:\nBid us sign Thy harvest home."
