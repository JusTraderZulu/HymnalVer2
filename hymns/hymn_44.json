    "lyrics": "Lord, teach us how to pray aright\nWith reverence and with fear;\nThough dust and ashes in Thy sight,\nWe may, we must draw near.\n\nWe perish if we cease from prayer;\nO grant us power to pray;\nAnd, when to meet Thee we prepare,\nLord, meet us by the way.\n\nGod of all grace, we bring to Thee\nA broken contrite heart;\nGive what Thine eye delights to see,\nTruth in the inward part:\n\nFaith in the only Sacrifice\nThat can for sin atone;\nTo cast our hopes, to fix our eyes,\nOn Christ, on Christ alone.\n\nPatience to watch, and wait, and weep,\nThough mercy long delay;\nCourage our fainting souls to keep,\nAnd trust Thee though Thou slay;\n\nGive these, and then Thy will be done;\nThus, strengthened with all might,\nWe through Thy Spirit and Thy Son,\nShall pray, and pray aright."
