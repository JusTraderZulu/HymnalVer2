[Refrain]\n\n3 When at the judgment bar\nI stand before my King,\nAnd He the book will open,\nHe cannot find a thing;\nThen will my heart be glad,\nWhile tears of joy will flow,\nBecause I had it settled,\nAnd settled long ago. [Refrain]\n\n4 O sinner, seek the Lord,\nRepent of all your sin;\nFor thus He has commanded,\nIf you would enter in;\nAnd then if you should live\nA hundred years below,\nE'en here you’ll not regret it,\nYou settled long ago. [Refrain]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoor I was, and sought for riches,\nSomething that would satisfy,\nBut the dust I gathered round me\nOnly mocked my soul’s sad cry.\n\nWell of water, ever springing,\nBread of life so rich and free,\nUntold wealth that never faileth,\nMy Redeemer is to me.\n\nAll my life I had a longing\nFor a drink from some clear spring,\nThat I hoped would quench the\nburning\nOf the thirst I felt within.\n\nChorus\nHallelujah! I have found Him\nWhom my soul so long has craved!\nJesus satisfies my longings,\nThrough His blood I now am saved.\n\nFeeding on the husks around me,\nTill my strength was almost gone,\nLonged my soul for something better,\nOnly still to hunger on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Riches I heed not, nor vain empty\npraise;\nthou mine inheritance, now and always.\nThou and thou only, first in my heart,\nRuler of heaven, my treasure thou art.\n\n5 \"*True Light of heaven, when vict’ry is\nwon\nmay I reach heaven’s joys, O bright\nheav’n’s Sun!\nHeart of my heart, whatever befall,\nstill be my vision, O Ruler of all.\n\n1 Be thou my vision, O Lord of my heart;\nnaught be all else to me, save that thou\nart.\nThou my best thought, by day or by\nnight,\nwaking or sleeping, thy presence my\nlight.\n\n2 Be thou my wisdom, be thou my true\nword;\nI ever with thee, and thou with me, Lord.\nBorn of thy love, thy child may I be,\nthou in me dwelling and I one with thee.\n\n3 Be thou my buckler, my sword for the\nfight.\nBe thou my dignity, thou my delight,\nthou my soul’s shelter, thou my high\ntow’r.\nRaise thou me heav’nward, O Pow’r of\nmy pow’r.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 And can it be that I should gain\nAn int'rest in the Savior's blood?\nDied He for me, who caused His pain?\nFor me, who Him to death pursued?\nAmazing love! how can it be\nThat Thou, my God, should die for me?\n\nRefrain:\nAmazing love! how can it be\nThat Thou, my God, should die for me!\n\n2 'Tis mystery all! Th'Immortal dies!\nWho can explore His strange design?\nIn vain the firstborn seraph tries\nTo sound the depths of love divine!\n'Tis mercy all! let earth adore,\nLet angel minds inquire no more.\n[Refrain]\n\n3 He left His Father's throne above,\nSo free, so infinite His grace;\nEmptied Himself of all but love,\nAnd bled for Adam's helpless race;\n\n'Tis mercy all, immense and free;\nFor, O my God, it found out me. [Refrain]\n\n4 Long my imprisoned spirit lay\nFast bound in sin and nature's night;\nThine eye diffused a quick'ning ray,\nI woke, the dungeon flamed with light;\nMy chains fell off, my heart was free;\nI rose, went forth and followed Thee.\n[Refrain]\n\n5 No condemnation now I dread;\nJesus, and all in Him is mine!\nAlive in Him, my living Head,\nAnd clothed in righteousness divine,\nBold I approach th'eternal throne,\nAnd claim the crown, through Christ my\nown. [Refrain]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Behold Him there, the risen Lamb!\nMy perfect, spotless Righteousness;\nthe great unchangeable I AM,\nthe King of glory and of grace!\nOne with Himself I cannot die;\nmy soul is purchased with His blood;\nmy life is hid with Christ on high,\nwith Christ my Savior and my God;\nwith Christ my Savior and my God!"
