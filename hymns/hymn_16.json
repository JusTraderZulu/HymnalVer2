    "lyrics": "To God be the glory\nGreat things He hath done,\nSo loved He the world\nThat He gave us His son:\nWho yielded His life\nAn atonement for sin,\nAnd opened the life-gate\nThat all may go in.\n\nCHORUS:\nPraise the Lord,\nPraise the Lord\nLet the Earth hear His voice,\nPraise the Lord,\nPraise the Lord,\nLet the People rejoice;\nOh come to the Father,\nThrough Jesus the Son\nAnd give Him the glory\nGreat things He hath done.\n\nOh perfect redemption,\nThe purchase of blood,\nTo every believer\nThe promise of God;\nThe vilest offender\nWho truly believes\nThat moment from Jesus\nA pardon receives.\n\nGreat things He hath taught us,\nGreat things He hath done,\nAnd great our rejoicing\nThrough Jesus the Son;\nBut purer, and higher\nAnd greater will be,\nOur wonder, our transport,\nWhen Jesus we see."
