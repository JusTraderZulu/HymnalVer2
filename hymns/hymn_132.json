    "bio": "Isaac Watts was an English Christian minister, hymn writer, theologian, and logician. Revered as the 'Father of English Hymnody,' Watts introduced new hymns as an alternative to the Psalms in the scriptures, which were traditionally sung in public worship. His hymns were known for their theological depth, emotional expression, and devotional warmth, encouraging the congregation's active participation in worship. 'My Shepherd Will Supply My Needs' is based on Psalm 23, exemplifying Watts' ability to paraphrase biblical psalms into hymns that resonate with Christian devotion and assurance."

  "lyrics": "1. My Shepherd will supply my need;\nJehovah is His Name;\nIn pastures fresh He makes me feed\nBeside the living stream.\n\n2. He brings my wand’ring spirit back\nWhen I forsake His ways,\nAnd leads me, for His mercy’s sake,\nIn paths of truth and grace.\n\n3. Thy hand, in sight of all my foes,\nDoth still my table spread;\nMy cup with blessings overflows;\nThine oil anoints my head.\n\n4. When I walk through the shades of death,\nThy presence is my stay;\nA word of Thy supporting breath\nDrives all my fears away.\n\n5. The sure provisions of my God\nAttend me all my days;\nO may Thy house be mine abode,\nAnd all my work be praise!\n\n6. There will I find a settled rest\nWhile others go and come,\nNo more a stranger or a guest,\nBut like a child at home."
