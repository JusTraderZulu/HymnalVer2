    "lyrics": "The cross upon which Jesus died,\nIs a shelter in which we can hide,\nAnd it's grace so free\nIs sufficient for me\nAnd deep is its fountain\nAs wide as the sea.\n\nCHORUS:\nThere's room\nAt the cross for you\nThere's room\nAt the cross for you\nThough millions have come\nThere's still room for one\nYes, there's room\nAt the cross for you.\n\n2. Though millions\nHave found Him a friend\nAnd have turned from\nThe sins they have sinned,\nThe Saviour still waits\nTo open the gates\nAnd welcome a sinner\nBefore it's too late.\n\n3. The hand\nOf my Saviour is strong,\nAnd the love\nOf my Saviour is long\nThrough sunshine or rain\nThrough loss or in gain\nThe blood flows from\nCalvary to cleanse every stain."
