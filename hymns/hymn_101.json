    "lyrics": "1 Precious Lord, take my hand\nLead me on, help me stand\nI am tired, I am weak,\nI am worn\nThrough the storm\nThrough the night\nLead me on to the light\nTake my hand, precious Lord,\nLead me home\n\n2 When my way grows drear,\nPrecious Lord, linger near,\nWhen my life is almost gone\nHear my cry, hear my call,\nHold my hand, lest I fall\nTake my hand, precious Lord,\nLead me Home"
