    "lyrics": "I heard an old, old story\nHow a Saviour came from glory\nHow He gave his life on Calvary\nTo save a wretch like me\nI heard about His groaning\nOf His precious blood's atoning\nThen I repented of my sins\nAnd won the victory.\n\nCHORUS\nO, victory in Jesus,\nMy Saviour, forever\nHe sought me and bought me\nWith His redeeming blood,\nHe loved me ere l knew Him\nAnd all my love is due Him\nHe plunged me to victory\nBeneath the cleansing flood.\n\nI heard about His healing\nOf His cleansing power revealing,\nHow he made the lame to walk again\nAnd caused the blind to see\nAnd then I cried dear Jesus\nCome and heal my broken Spirit,\nAnd somehow Jesus came\nAnd brought to me the victory\n\nI heard about a mansion\nHe 'had built for me in glory\nAnd I heard about the streets of gold\nBeyond the crystal sea\nAbout the Angels singing\nAnd the old redemption story\nAnd some sweet day I'll sing\nUp there the song of victory."
