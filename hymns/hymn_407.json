Give light, O Lord, that we may know\nThy one unchanging truth,\nAnd follow all our days below,\nOur guide in youth.\n\n3. Give light, O Lord, that we may see\nWhere wisdom bids beware,\nAnd turn our doubting minds to Thee\nIn faithful prayer.\n\n4. Give light, O Lord, that we may look\nBeneath, around, above,\nAnd learn from nature's living book\nThy power and love.\n\n5. Give light, O Lord, that we may read\nAll signs that Thou art near,\nAnd, while we live, in word and deed\nThy Name revere.\n\n6. Give light, O Lord, that we may trace\nIn trial, pain and loss,\nIn poorest lot, and lowest place,\nA Saviour's Cross.\n\n7. Give light, O Lord, that we may see\nA home beyond the sky,\nWhere all who live in Christ with Thee\nShall never die."
