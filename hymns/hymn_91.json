  "lyrics": "Brightly beams our Father's mercy\nFrom His lighthouse evermore,\nBut to us He gives the keeping\nOf the lights along the shore.\n\nCHORUS:\nLet the lower lights be burning!\nSend a gleam across the wave!\nSome poor fainting, struggling seaman\nYou may rescue, you may save.\n\nDark the night of sin has settled,\nLoud the angry billows roar;\nEager eyes are watching, longing,\nFor the lights along the shore.\n\nTrim your feeble lamp, my brother!\nSome poor sailor tempest-tossed,\nTrying now to make the harbor,\nIn the darkness may be lost."
