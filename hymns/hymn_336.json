    "lyrics": "All people that on Earth do dwell,\nSing to the Lord with cheerful voice,\nHim serve with fear His praise foretell,\nCome ye before Him and rejoice.\n\nThe Lord ye know is God indeed,\nWithout our aid He did us make\nWe are His folk He doth us feed,\nAnd for His sheep He doth us take.\n\nO enter then His Gates with praise,\nApproach with joy His courts unto\nPraise laud and bless His name always,\nFor it is seemly so to do.\n\nFor why? the Lord our God is good\nHis mercy is for ever sure,\nHis truth at all times firmly stood,\nAnd shall from age to age endure.\n\nTo Father, Son and Holy Ghost,\nThe God whom Heaven and Earth adore,\nFrom men and from the Angel host\nBe praise and glory evermore."
