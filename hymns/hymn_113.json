    "lyrics": "Not all the blood of beasts\nOn Jewish altars slain,\nCould give the guilty conscience peace,\nOr wash away the stain.\n\nBut Christ the Heavenly Lamb\nTakes all our sins away\nA sacrifice of noble name\nAnd richer blood than they.\n\nMy faith would lay her hand\nOn that dear head of Thine,\nWhile like a penitent I stand,\nAnd there confess my sin.\n\nMy soul look back to see,\nThe burden Thou didst bear\nWhen hanging on the accursed Tree,\nAnd knows her guilt was there."
