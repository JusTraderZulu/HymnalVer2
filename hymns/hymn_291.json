Lives again our glorious King:\nAlleluia!\nWhere, O death, is now Thy sting?\nAlleluia!\nDying once, He all doth save:\nAlleluia!\nWhere the victory, O grave?\nAlleluia!\n\n3. Love's redeeming work is done:\nAlleluia!\nFought the fight, the battle won:\nAlleluia!\nDeath in vain forbids Him rise:\nAlleluia!\nChrist has opened paradise:\nAlleluia!\n\n4. Soar we now, where Christ has led:\nAlleluia!\nFollowing our exalted head:\nAlleluia!\nMade like Him, like Him we rise:\nAlleluia!\nOurs the cross, the grave, the skies:\nAlleluia!"
