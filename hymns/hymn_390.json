    "lyrics": "And am I born to die?\nTo lay this body down?\nAnd must my trembling spirit fly\nInto a world unknown?\n\nWaked by the trumpet's sound,\nI from the grave must rise,\nAnd see the judge\nWith glory crowned\nAnd see the flaming skies.\n\nHow shall I leave my tomb?\nWith triumph, or regret?\nA fearful or a joyful doom,\nA curse of blessing, meet?\n\nI must from God be driven,\nOr with my Saviour dwell,\nMust come, at His command, to Heaven,\nOr else depart to hell.\n\nO Thou, that wouldst not have,\nOne wretched sinner die,\nWho diedst Thyself,\nMy soul to save,\nFrom endless misery.\n\nShow me the way to shun,\nThy dreadful wrath severe,\nThat, when Thou comest\nOn Thy throne,\nI may with joy appear."
