  "lyrics": "1 Before the throne of God above\nI have a strong and perfect plea,\na great High Priest whose name is \"Love,\"\nwho ever lives and pleads for me.\nMy name is graven on His hands;\nmy name is written on His heart;\nI know that while in heav'n He stands,\nno tongue can bid me thence depart;\nno tongue can bid me thence depart.\n\n2 When Satan tempts me to despair,\nand tells me of the guilt within,\nupward I look and see Him there\nwho made an end of all my sin.\nBecause the sinless Savior died,\nmy sinful soul is counted free;\nfor God the Just is satisfied\nto look on Him and pardon me;\nto look on Him and pardon me."
