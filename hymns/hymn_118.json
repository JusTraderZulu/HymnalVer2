    "lyrics": "Once again the gospel message,\nFrom the Saviour you have heard\nWill you heed the invitation?\nWill you turn and seek the Lord?\n\nCHORUS:\nCome believing, come believing\nCome to Jesus, look and live\nCome believing, come believing\nCome to Jesus, look and live.\n\nMany summers you have wasted\nRipened harvests you have seen\nWinter snows by spring have melted\nYet you linger in your sin\n\nJesus for your choice is waiting\nTarry not at once decide,\nWhile the Spirit now is striving\nYield and seek the Saviour's side.\n\nCease of fitness to be thinking,\nDo not longer try to feel;\nIt is trusting and not feeling,\nThat will give the Spirit's seal.\n\nLet your will to God be given,\nTrust in Christ's atoning blood\nLook to Jesus now in Heaven,\nRest on His unchanging word."
