      "bio": "Isaac Williams was a British clergyman and poet associated with the Oxford Movement, a movement that sought to revive the catholic aspects of the Anglican Church. His contributions to hymnody and religious poetry reflect the movement's emphasis on the beauty of traditional liturgy and the depth of Anglican spirituality. Williams is known for his deeply reflective and contemplative hymns, which often explore themes of repentance, redemption, and the mysteries of faith."

    "lyrics": "Lord, in this Thy mercy's day,\nEre it pass for aye away,\nOn our knees we fall and pray.\n\nHoly Jesu, grant us tears,\nFill us with heart-searching fears,\nEre that awful doom appears.\n\nLord, on us Thy Spirit pour\nKneeling lowly at the door,\nEre it close for evermore.\n\nBy Thy night of agony,\nBy Thy supplicating cry,\nBy Thy willingness to die;\n\nBy Thy tears of bitter woe\nFor Jerusalem below,\nLet us not Thy love forego.\n\nGrant us neath Thy wings a place\nLest we lose this day of grace\nEre we shall behold Thy face."
