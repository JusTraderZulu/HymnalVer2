  "lyrics": "1 O come, O come, Immanuel,\nand ransom captive Israel\nthat mourns in lonely exile here\nuntil the Son of God appear.\n\nRefrain:\nRejoice! Rejoice! Immanuel\nshall come to you, O Israel.\n\n2 O come, O Wisdom from on high,\nwho ordered all things mightily;\nto us the path of knowledge show\nand teach us in its ways to go. Refrain\n\n3 O come, O come, great Lord of might,\nwho to your tribes on Sinai's height\nin ancient times did give the law\nin cloud and majesty and awe. Refrain\n\n4 O come, O Branch of Jesse's stem,\nunto your own and rescue them!\nFrom depths of hell your people save,\nand give them victory o'er the grave. Refrain\n\n5 O come, O Key of David, come\nand open wide our heavenly home.\nMake safe for us the heavenward road\nand bar the way to death's abode. Refrain\n6 O come, O Bright and Morning Star,\nand bring us comfort from afar!\nDispel the shadows of the night\nand turn our darkness into light. Refrain\n\n7 O come, O King of nations, bind\nin one the hearts of all mankind.\nBid all our sad divisions cease\nand be yourself our King of Peace. Refrain"
