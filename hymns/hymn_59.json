    "lyrics": "I was sinking deep in sin,\nFar from the peaceful shore,\nVery deeply stained within,\nSinking to rise no more;\nBut the Master of the sea\nHeard my despairing cry,\nFrom the waters lifted me,\nNow Safe am I.\n\nCHORUS:\nLove lifted me, love lifted me\nWhen nothing else could help,\nLove lifted me,\nLove lifted me (repeat)\n\nAll my heart to Him I give,\nEver to Him I'll cling,\nIn His blessed presence live,\nEver His praises sing.\nLove so mighty and so true\nMerits my soul's best songs\nFaithful, loving service, too.\nTo Him belongs.\n\nSouls in danger, look above\nJesus completely saves;\nHe will lift you by His love\nOut of the angry waves.\nHe's the Master of the sea,\nBillows His will obey;\nHe your Saviour wants to be\nBe saved today."
