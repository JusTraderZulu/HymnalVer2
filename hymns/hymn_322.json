    "lyrics": "Far, far away in heathen\nDarkness dwelling,\nMillions of souls\nFor ever may be lost;\nWho, who will go salvation's\nStory telling..\nLooking to Jesus,\nCounting not the cost?\n\nCHORUS\n\"All power is given unto me,\nAll power is given unto me,\nGo ye into all the world\nAnd preach the Gospel;\nAnd lo, I am with you always\"\n\nSee o'er the world\nWide open doors inviting:\nSoldiers of Christ,\nArise and enter in,\nChristians, awake:\nYour forces all uniting,\nSend forth the Gospel,\nBreak the chains of sin.\n\n\"Why will ye die?\"\nThe voice of God is calling;\n\"Why will ye die?'\nRe-echo in His name:\nJesus hath died to save from\nDeath appalling;\nLife and salvation\nTherefore go proclaim.\n\nGod speed the day\nWhen those of every nation.\n\"Glory to God\"\nTriumphantly shall sing;\nRansomed, redeemed,\nRejoicing in salvation,\nShout \"Hallelujah,\nFor the Lord is King.\""
