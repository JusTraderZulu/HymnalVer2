    "lyrics": "Behold me standing at the door,\nAnd hear me pleading evermore,\nWith gentle voice: Oh, heart of sin,\nMay I come in? May I come in?\n\nCHORUS:\nBehold me standing at the door,\nAnd hear me pleading evermore;\nSay weary heart, oppressed with sin,\nMay I come in? May I come in?\n\nI bore the cruel thorns for thee,\nI waited long and patiently;\nSay weary heart, oppressed with sin,\nMay I come in? May I come in?\n\nI would not plead with thee in vain;\nRemember all my grief and pain;\nI died to ransom thee from sin;\nMay I come in? May I come in?\n\nI bring thee joy from Heaven above\nI bring thee pardon, peace, and love;\nSay, weary heart, oppressed with sin,\nMay I come in? May I come in?"
