    "lyrics": "1\nOnward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war,\nWith the cross of Jesus going on before.\nChrist, the royal Master, leads against the foe;\nForward into battle see His banners go!\n\nRefrain:\nOnward, Christian soldiers,\nMarching as to war,\nWith the cross of Jesus\nGoing on before.\n\n2\nAt the sign of triumph Satan’s host doth flee;\nOn then, Christian soldiers, on to victory!\nHell’s foundations quiver at the shout of praise;\nBrothers, lift your voices, loud your anthems raise.\n\n3\nLike a mighty army moves the church of God;\nBrothers, we are treading where the saints have trod.\nWe are not divided, all one body we,\nOne in hope and doctrine, one in charity.\n\n4\nCrowns and thrones may perish, kingdoms rise and wane,\nBut the church of Jesus constant will remain.\nGates of hell can never ’gainst that church prevail;\nWe have Christ’s own promise, and that cannot fail.\n\n5\nOnward then, ye people, join our happy throng,\nBlend with ours your voices in the triumph song.\nGlory, laud, and honor unto Christ the King,\nThis through countless ages men and angels sing."
