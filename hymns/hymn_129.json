'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,\nJust to take Him at His word;\nJust to rest upon His promise;\nJust to know, 'Thus saith the Lord.'\n\nCHORUS\nJesus, Jesus how I trust Him\nHow I've proved Him o'er and o'er\nJesus, Jesus precious Jesus\nO for grace to trust Him more!\n\nO how sweet to trust in Jesus,\nJust to trust His cleansing blood;\nJust in simple faith to plunge me\n'Neath the healing, cleansing flood!\n\nYes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus,\nJust from sin and self to cease;\nJust from Jesus simply taking\nLife and rest, and joy and peace.\n\nI'm so glad I learned to trust Thee,\nPrecious Jesus, Saviour, Friend;\nAnd I know that Thou art with me,\nWilt be with me to the end."
