I came to Jesus, weary, worn and sad,\\nHe took my sins away, He took my sins away;\\nAnd now His love has made my heart so glad,\\nHe took my sins away.\\n\\nCHORUS:\\nHe took my sins away, He took my sins away,\\nAnd keeps me singing every day;\\nI'm so glad He took my sins away,\\nHe took my sins away.\\n\\n2. The load of sin was more than I could bear,\\nHe took them all away, He took them all away;\\nAnd now on Him I roll my every care,\\nHe took my sins away.\\n\\n3. No condemnation have I in my heart,\\nHe took my sins away, He took my sins away;\\nHis perfect peace He did to me impart,\\nHe took my sins away.\\n\\n4. If you will come to Jesus Christ today,\\nHe'll take your sins away, He'll take your sins away;\\nAnd keep you happy in His love each day,\\nHe'll take your sins away."
