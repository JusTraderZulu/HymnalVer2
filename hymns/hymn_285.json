    "lyrics": "Lord, Jesus, think on me,\nAnd purge away my sin;\nFrom Earth born passions set me free,\nAnd make me pure within.\n\nLord Jesus, think on me,\nWith many a care opprest,\nLet me Thy loving servant be,\nAnd taste Thy promised rest.\n\nLord Jesus, think on me,\nNor let me go astray;\nThrough darkness and perplexity,\nPoint Thou the Heavenly way.\n\nLord Jesus, think on me,\nThat when the flood is past,\nI may the Eternal brightness see,\nAnd share Thy joy at last.\n\nLord Jesus, think on me,\nThat I may sing above,\nPraise to the Father, and to Thee,\nAnd to the Holy dove."
