    "lyrics": "Yield not to temptation,\nFor yielding is sin,\nEach victory will help you\nSome other to win;\nFight manfully onward,\nDark passions subdue,\nLook ever to Jesus,\nHe'll carry you through.\n\nCHORUS:\nAsk the Saviour to help you,\nComfort, strengthen and keep you,\nHe is willing to aid you,\nHe will carry you through.\n\nShun evil companions,\nBad language disdain,\nGod's name hold in reverence,\nNot take it in vain,\nBe thoughtful and earnest,\nKind-hearted and true,\nLook ever to Jesus,\nHe'll carry you through.\n\nTo him that overcometh,\nGod giveth a crown,\nThrough faith we shall conquer,\nThough often cast down,\nHe who is our Saviour\nOur strength will renew,\nLook ever to Jesus,\nHe'll carry you through."
