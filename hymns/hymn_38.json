    "lyrics": "Lo! He comes\nWith clouds descending,\nOnce for favored\nSinners slain,\nThousand thousand\nSaints attending,\nSwell the triumph\nOf His train;\nHallelujah!\nJesus comes,\nAnd comes to reign.\n\nEvery eye\nShall now behold Him\nRobed in dreadful\nMajesty;\nThose who set\nAt nought and sold\nHim,\nPierced and nailed Him\nTo the tree,\nDeeply wailing,\nShall the true Messiah\nSee.\n\nWhen the solemn\nTrump has sounded,\nHeaven and Earth\nShall flee away,\nAll who hate Him\nMust, confounded,\nHear the summons\nOf that day,\nCome to judgment,\nCome to judgment,\nCome away.\n\nNow redemption,\nLong expected,\nSee in solemn\nPomp appear,\nAll His Saints,\nBy men rejected,\nNow shall meet Him\nIn the air,\nHallelujah,\nSee the day of God\nAppear.\n\nYea, Amen!\nLet all adore Thee,\nHigh on Thy eternal\nThrone,\nSavior, take\nThe power and glory,\nClaim the kingdom\nFor Thine own;\nOh, come quickly,\nHallelujah, Come, Lord,\nCome."
