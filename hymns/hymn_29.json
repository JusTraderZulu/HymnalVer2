    "lyrics": "Guide me, O Thou great\nJehovah\nPilgrim through this barren land.\nI am weak, but Thou art mighty\nHold me with Thy powerful hand;\nBread of Heaven!\nFeed me till I want no more.\n\nOpen now the crystal fountain,\nWhence the healing waters flow;\nLet the fiery, cloudy pillar\nLead me all my journey through;\nStrong Deliverer!\nBe Thou still my strength and shield.\n\nWhen I tread the verge of\nJordan,\nBid my anxious fears subside;\nBear me through the swelling\ncurrent,\nLand me safe on Canaan's side.\nSongs of praises\nI will ever give to Thee."
