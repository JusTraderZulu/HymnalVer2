    "lyrics": "1. Oh it is hard to work for God,\nTo rise and take His part,\nUpon this battlefield of Earth,\nAnd not sometimes lose heart.\n\n2. He hides himself so wondrously,\nAs though there were no God,\nHe is least seen when all the powers,\nOf ill are most abroad.\n\n3. Ah God is other than we think,\nHis ways are far above,\nFar beyond reason's height and reached\nOnly by childlike love.\n\n4. Workman of God O lose not heart,\nBut learn what God is like\nAnd in the darkest battlefield,\nThou shalt know where to strike.\n\n5. Then learn to scorn the praise of men,\nAnd learn to lose with God\nFor Jesus won the world through shame,\nAnd beckons thee His road.\n\n6. For right is right as God is God,\nAnd right the day must win,\nTo doubt would be disloyalty,\nTo falter were to sin."
