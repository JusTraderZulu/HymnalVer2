    "lyrics": "We shall sleep, but not forever,\nThere will be a glorious dawn,\nWe shall meet to part - no, never,\nOn the resurrection morn,\nFrom the deepest caves of ocean,\nFrom the desert and the plain,\nFrom the valley and the mountain\nCountless throngs shall rise again.\n\nCHORUS:\nWe shall sleep,\nBut not for ever,\nThere will be a glorious dawn,\nWe shall meet to part - no, never,\nOn the resurrection morn.\n\nWhen we see a precious blossom,\nThat we tended with such care,\nRudely taken from our bosom,\nHow our aching hearts despair,\nRound its little grave we linger,\nTill the setting sun is low;\nFeeling all our hopes have perished,\nWith the flower we cherished so.\n\nWe shall sleep, but not for ever\nIn the lone and silent grave,\nBlessed be the Lord that taketh\nBlessed be the Lord that gave,\nIn the bright, eternal city,\nDeath can never, never come\nIn His own good time He'll call us,\nFrom our rest to home, sweet home."
