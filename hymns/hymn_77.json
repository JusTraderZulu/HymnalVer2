  "lyrics": "Will your anchor hold\nIn the storms of life,\nWhen the clouds unfold\nTheir wings of strife?\nWhen the strong tides lift,\nAnd the cables strain,\nWill your anchor drift,\nOr firm remain?\n\nCHORUS:\nWe have an anchor\nThat keeps the soul\nSteadfast and sure\nWhile the billows roll;\nFastened to the Rock\nWhich cannot move,\nGrounded firm and deep\nIn the Saviour's love!\n\nWill your anchor hold\nIn the straits of fear?\nWhen the breakers roar\nAnd the reef is near;\nWhile the surges rave,\nAnd the wild winds blow,\nShall the angry waves\nThen your bark o'erflow?\n\nWill your anchor hold\nIn the floods of death,\nWhen the waters cold\nChill your latest breath?\nOn the rising tide\nYou can never fail,\nWhile your anchor holds\nWithin the veil.\n\nWill your eyes behold\nThrough the morning light\nThe city of gold\nAnd the harbor bright?\nWill you anchor safe\nBy the Heavenly shore,\nWhen life's storms\nAre past forevermore?"
