    "lyrics": "When God of old came down from Heaven,\nIn power and wrath He came;\nBefore His feet the clouds were riven,\nHalf darkness and half flame.\n\nBut when He came the second time,\nHe came in power and love;\nSofter than gale at morning prime,\nHovered His Holy Dove.\n\nThe fires that rushed on Sinai down\nIn sudden torrents dread\nNow gently light, a glorious crown,\nOn every sainted head.\n\nAnd as on Israel's awestruck ear,\nThe voice exceeding loud,\nThe trumpet that angels quake to hear,\nThrilled from the deep, dark cloud.\n\nSo, when the Spirit of our God\nCame down His flock to find,\nA voice from Heaven was heard abroad,\nA rushing mighty wind.\n\nIt fills the Church of God,\nIt fills the sinful world around;\nOnly in stubborn hearts and wills\nNo place for it is found.\n\nCome Lord, come wisdom, love, and power;\nOpen our ears to hear;\nLet us not miss the accepted hour;\nSave, Lord, by love or fear."
