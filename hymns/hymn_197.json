    "lyrics": "1. When my life‑work is ended, and I cross the swelling tide,\\nWhen the bright and glorious morning I shall see,\\nI shall know my Redeemer when I reach the other side,\\nAnd His smile will be the first to welcome me.\\n\\nCHORUS:\\nI shall know Him, I shall know Him,\\nAnd redeemed by His side I shall stand;\\nI shall know Him, I shall know Him,\\nBy the print of the nails in His hand.\\n\\n2. Oh, the soul‑thrilling rapture when I view His blessed face,\\nAnd the luster of His kindly beaming eye;\\nHow my full heart will praise Him for the mercy, love and grace,\\nThat prepared for me a mansion in the sky.\\n\\n3. Oh, the dear ones in glory, how they beckon me to come,\\nAnd our parting at the river I recall;\\nTo the sweet vales of Eden they will sing my welcome home,\\nBut I long to meet my Saviour first of all.\\n\\n4. Through the gates to the city, in a robe of spotless white,\\nHe will lead me where no tears will ever fall;\\nIn the glad song of ages I shall mingle with delight,\\nBut I long to meet my Saviour first of all."
