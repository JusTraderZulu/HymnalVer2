  "lyrics": "Hear my cry O Lord attend unto my prayer\nFrom the ends of the earth will I cry out to Thee.\nAnd when my heart is overwhelmed, Oh Lord,\nLead me to the Rock that is higher than I,\nThat is higher than I.\n\nFor Thou hast been a shelter unto me,\nA high tower, Lord, against the enemy.\nAnd when my heart is overwhelmed, Oh Lord,\nLead me to the Rock that is higher than I,\nThat is higher than I.\n\nThat is higher than I,\nThat is higher than I.\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. I once was an outcast stranger on earth,\nA sinner by choice, and an alien by birth,\nBut I’ve been adopted, my name’s written\ndown,\nAn heir to a mansion, a robe and a crown.\n\n4. A tent or a cottage, why should I care?\nThey’re building a palace for me over there;\nThough exiled from home, yet still may I\nsing:\nAll glory to God, I’m a child of the King!\n\nI am a Child of the King\n\n1. My Father is rich in houses and lands,\n\nHe holdeth the wealth of the world in His\nhands!\nOf rubies and diamonds, of silver and gold,\nHis coffers are full, He has riches untold.\n\nRefrain:\nI’m a child of the King,\nA child of the King:\nWith Jesus my Savior,\nI’m a child of the King!\n\n2. My Father’s own Son, the Savior of men,\nOnce wandered on earth as the poorest of\nthem;\nBut now He is pleading our pardon on high,\nThat we may be His, when He comes by and\nby."
