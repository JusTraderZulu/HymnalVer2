Christ our Redeemer\nDied on the cross,\nDied for the sinner,\nPaid all his due;\nSprinkle your soul\nWith the blood of the Lamb,\nAnd I will pass,\nWill pass over you.\n\nCHORUS:\nWhen I see the blood,\nWhen I see the blood,\nWhen I see the blood,\nI will pass,\nI will pass over you.\n\n2. Chiefest of sinners,\nJesus will save;\nAll He has promised,\nThat will He do;\nWash in the fountain\nOpened for sin,\nAnd I will pass,\nWill pass over you.\n\n3. Judgment is coming\nAll will be there,\nEach one receiving\nJustly his due;\nHide in the saving,\nSin‑cleansing blood,\nAnd I will pass,\nWill pass over you.\n\n4. Oh, great compassion!\nO boundless love!\nO loving kindness,\nFaithful and true!\nFind peace and shelter\nUnder the blood,\nAnd I will pass,\nWill pass over you."
