  "lyrics": "When I survey the wondrous cross\nOn which the Prince of glory died,\nMy richest gain I count but loss,\nAnd pour contempt on all my pride.\n\nForbid it, Lord, that I should boast,\nSave in the death of Christ, my God;\nAll the vain things that charm me most,\nI sacrifice them to His blood.\n\nSee, from His head, His hands, His feet,\nSorrow and love flow mingled down;\nDid e'er such love and sorrow meet,\nOr thorns compose so rich a crown?\n\nWere the whole realm of nature mine,\nThat were an offering far too small;\nLove so amazing, so divine,\nDemands my soul, my life, my all."
