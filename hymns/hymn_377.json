    "lyrics": "While shepherds watched\nTheir flocks by night,\nAll seated on the ground\nThe Angel of the Lord came down,\nAnd glory shone around.\n\nFear not said he\nFor mighty dread,\nHad seized their troubled mind,\nGlad tidings of Great joy I bring,\nTo you and all mankind.\n\nTo you in David's town this day,\nIs born of David's line,\nA Saviour who is Christ the Lord,\nAnd this shall be the sign\n\nThe Heavenly babe\nYou there shall find,\nTo human view displayed,\nAll meanly wrapped\nIn swathing bands\nAnd in a manger laid.\n\nThus spake the seraph and forthwith\nAppeared a shining throng,\nOf Angels praising God who thus\nAddressed their joyful song.\n\nAll glory be to God on high,\nAnd to the Earth be peace,\nGood will henceforth\nFrom Heaven to men,\nBegin and never cease."
