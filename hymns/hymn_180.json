Saviour, like a shepherd lead us,\\nMuch we need Thy tenderest care;\\nIn Thy pleasant pastures feed us,\\nFor our use Thy folds prepare.\\nBlessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,\\nThou hast bought us, Thine we are.\\n\\n2. We are Thine—do Thou befriend us,\\nBe the Guardian of our way;\\nKeep Thy flock, from sin defend us,\\nSeek us when we go astray.\\nBlessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,\\nHear, O hear us when we pray.\\n\\n3. Thou hast promised to receive us,\\nPoor and sinful though we be;\\nThou hast mercy to relieve us,\\nGrace to cleanse, and power to free.\\nBlessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,\\nLet us early turn to Thee.\\n\\n4. Early let us seek Thy favour,\\nEarly let us do Thy will;\\nBlessed Lord and only Saviour,\\nWith Thy love our bosoms fill.\\nBlessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,\\nThou hast loved us—love us still."
