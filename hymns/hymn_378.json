  "lyrics": "Praise O praise our God and King,\nHymns of adoration sing,\nFor His mercies still endure,\nEver faithful ever sure.\n\nPraise Him that He made the sun,\nDay by day His course to run,\nFor His mercies still endure\nEver faithful ever sure.\n\nAnd the silver moon by night,\nShining with her gentle light,\nFor His mercies still endure.\nEver faithful ever sure.\n\nPraise Him that He gave the rain,\nTo mature the swelling grain,\nFor His mercies still endure,\nEver faithful ever sure.\n\nAnd hath bid the fruitful field,\nCrops of precious increase yield,\nFor His mercies still endure,\nEver faithful ever sure.\n\nPraise Him for our harvest store,\nHe hath filled the garner floor,\nFor His mercies still endure,\nEver faithful ever sure.\n\nAnd for richer food than this,\nPledge of everlasting bliss,\nFor His mercies still endure,\nEver faithful ever sure.\n\nGlory to our bounteous King,\nGlory let creation sing,\nGlory to the Father Son\nAnd blest Spirit; God is One."
