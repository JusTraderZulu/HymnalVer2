    "lyrics": "I've found a friend in Jesus,\nHe's everything to me;\nHe's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul!\nThe lily of the valley,\nIn Him alone I see\nAll I need to cleanse and make me fully whole;\nIn sorrow He's my comfort,\nIn trouble He's my stay,\nHe tells me every care on Him to roll:\nHe's the lily of the valley,\nThe bright and morning star;\nHe's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.\n\nCHORUS:\nIn sorrow He's my comfort,\nIn trouble He's my stay;\nHe tells me every care on Him to roll:\nHe's the lily of the valley,\nThe bright and morning star;\nHe's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.\n\nHe all my grief has taken,\nAnd all my sorrows borne;\nIn temptation He's my strong and mighty tower;\nI've all for Him forsaken,\nI've all my idols torn\nFrom my heart and now He keeps me by His power.\nThough all the world forsake me,\nAnd Satan tempt me sore,\nThrough Jesus I shall safely reach the goal.\nHe's the lily of the valley,\nThe bright and morning star;\nHe's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.\n\nHe'll never, never leave me,\nNor yet forsake me here,\nWhile I live by faith, and do His blessed will;\nA wall of fire about me,\nI've nothing now to fear;\nWith His manna He my hungry soul shall fill.\nThen sweeping up to glory,\nI'll see His blessed face,\nWhere rivers of delight shall ever roll.\nHe's the lily of the valley,\nThe bright and morning star;\nHe's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul!"
