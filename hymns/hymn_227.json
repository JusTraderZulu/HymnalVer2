    "lyrics": "Spirit of faith, come down,\nReveal the things of God;\nAnd make to us the Godhead known,\nAnd witness with the blood.\n\n'Tis Thine the blood to apply,\nAnd give us eyes to see\nWho did for every sinner die\nHath surely died for me.\n\nNo man can truly say\nThat Jesus is the Lord,\nUnless Thou take the veil away,\nAnd breathe the living word.\n\nThen, only then, we feel\nOur interest in His blood,\nAnd cry, with joy unspeakable\nThou art my Lord, my God!\n\nO that the world might know\nThe all-atoning Lamb!\nSpirit of faith descend, and show\nThe virtue of His Name.\n\nThe grace which all may find,\nThe saving power impart;\nAnd testify to all mankind,\nAnd speak in every heart.\n\nInspire the living faith,\nWhich whosoever receives,\nThe witness in himself he hath,\nAnd consciously believes\n\nThe faith that conquers all,\nAnd doth the mountain move,\nAnd saves whoever on Jesus call,\nAnd perfects them in love."
