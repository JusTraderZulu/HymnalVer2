  "lyrics": "There is a fountain filled with blood\nDrawn from Immanuelâ€™s veins;\nAnd sinners, plunged beneath that flood,\nLose all their guilty stains.\n\nThe dying thief rejoiced to see\nThat fountain in his day;\nAnd there may I, though vile as he,\nWash all my sins away.\n\nE'er since by faith I saw the stream,\nThy flowing wounds supply,\nRedeeming love has been my theme,\nAnd shall be till I die.\n\nThen in a nobler sweeter song\nI'll sing Thy power to save,\nWhen this poor lisping, stammering tongue\nLies silent in the grave."
