    "lyrics": "1\nO brother, life’s journey beginning,\nWith courage and firmness arise!\nLook well to the course thou art choosing;\nBe earnest, be watchful, and wise!\nRemember—two paths are before thee,\nAnd both thy attention invite;\nBut one leadeth on to destruction,\nThe other to joy and delight.\n\nChorus:\nGod help you to follow His banner,\nAnd serve Him wherever you go;\nAnd when you are tempted, my brother,\nGod give you the grace to say No!\n\n2\nO brother, yield not to the tempter,\nNo matter what others may do;\nStand firm in the strength of the Master,\nBe loyal, be faithful, and true!\nEach trial will make you the stronger,\nIf you, in the name of the Lord,\nFight manfully under your Leader,\nObeying the voice of His Word.\n\n3\nO brother, the Savior is calling!\nBeware of the danger of sin;\nResist not the voice of the Spirit,\nThat whispers so gently within.\nGod calls you to enter His service—\nTo live for Him here, day by day;\nAnd share by and by in the glory\nThat never shall vanish away."
