There’s a call comes ringing o’er the restless wave,\\n\"Send the light, send the light!\"\\nThere are souls to rescue, there are souls to save,\\n\"Send the light, send the light!\"\\n\\nCHORUS:\\nSend the light, the blessed Gospel light;\\nLet it shine from shore to shore!\\nSend the light, the blessed Gospel light;\\nLet it shine for evermore.\\n\\n2. We have heard the Macedonian call today,\\n\"Send the light, send the light!\"\\nAnd our grateful offerings at the cross we lay,\\n\"Send the light, send the light!\"\\n\\n3. May the grace of Jesus unto all abound,\\n\"Send the light, send the light!\"\\nAnd a Christ‑like spirit everywhere be found,\\n\"Send the light, send the light!\"\\n\\n4. Let us not grow weary in the work of love,\\n\"Send the light, send the light!\"\\nWhile we gather jewels for our crown above,\\n\"Send the light, send the light!\""
