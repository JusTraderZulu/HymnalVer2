    "lyrics": "1. We have not seen, we cannot see,\nThe happy land above,\nFrom sin and death and suffering free,\nWhere all is peace and love.\n\n2. We only see the path is long\nBy which we have to go;\nWe only feel the foes are strong\nWho seek to work us woe.\n\n3. We have not seen, we cannot see\nThe cross our Master bore,\nWith all its pains, that we might be\nThe slaves of sin no more.\n\n4. We only think it hard to part\nWith every pleasant sin,\nAnd give to God a perfect heart,\nAnd make Him Lord within.\n\n5. We walk by faith, and not by sight;\nAnd, blessèd saint, like thee,\nWe sometimes doubt if faith tells right,\nBecause we cannot see.\n\n6. Upon the promise we would lean\nThy doubting heart received;\nBlessèd are they that have not seen,\nAnd that have yet believed."
