    "lyrics": "For ever with the Lord,\nAmen so let it be,\nLife from the dead\nIs in that word,\nT'is immortality.\nHere in the body pent,\nAbsent from Him I roam,\nYet nightly pitch my moving tent,\nA day's march nearer home.\nMy Father's house on high,\nHome of my soul how near,\nAt times to faith's foreseeing eye,\nThy golden gates appear.\nAh then my spirit faints,\nTo reach the land I love,\nThe bright inheritance of Saints\nJerusalem above.\nFor ever with the Lord,\nFather if t'is Thy will,\nThe promise of that faithful word,\nEven here to me fulfill.\nBe Thou at my right hand,\nThen can I never fail;\nUphold Thou me and I shall stand,\nFight and I must prevail.\nSo when my latest breath,\nShall rend the veil in twain,\nBy death I shall escape from death,\nAnd Life Eternal gain.\nKnowing as I am known,\nHow shall I love that word,\nAnd oft repeat before the throne,\nFor ever with the Lord."
