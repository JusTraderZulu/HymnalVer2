  "lyrics": "Search me, O God,\nAnd know my heart today;\nTry me, O Saviour,\nKnow my thoughts, I pray.\nSee if there be\nSome wicked way in me;\nCleanse me from every\nSin and set me free.\n\nI praise Thee, Lord,\nFor cleansing me from sin;\nFulfill Thy word\nAnd make me pure within.\nFill me with fire\nWhere once I burned with shame;\nGrant my desire\nTo magnify Thy name.\n\nLord, take my life\nAnd make it wholly Thine;\nFill my poor heart\nWith Thy great love divine.\nTake all my will\nMy passion self and pride;\nI now surrender\nLord in me abide.\n\nO Holy Ghost,\nRevival comes from Thee;\nSend a revival\nStart the work in me.\nThy word declares\nThou wilt supply our need;\nFor blessings now,\nO Lord I humbly plead."
