  "lyrics": "1\nFather, I stretch my hands to Thee,\nNo other help I know;\nIf Thou withdraw Thyself from me,\nAh! whither shall I go?\n\nChorus:\nI do believe I do believe\nThat Jesus died for me\nAnd through His blood\nHis Precious blood\nI shall from sin be free\n\n2\nWhat did Thine only Son endure\nBefore I drew my breath!\nWhat pain, what labor, to secure\nMy soul from endless death!\n\n3\nO Jesus, could I this believe,\nI now should feel Thy power;\nAnd all my wants Thou wouldst relieve\nIn this, the accepted hour.\n\n4\nAuthor of faith, to Thee I lift\nMy weary, longing eyes;\nO let me now receive that gift!\nMy soul without it dies."
