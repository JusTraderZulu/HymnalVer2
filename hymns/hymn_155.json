    "lyrics": "1\nThe blood that Jesus shed for me,\nWay back on Calvary;\nIt's that blood that gives me strength from day to day,\nIt will never lose its power.\n\nChorus:\nIt reaches to the highest mountain.\nIt flows to the lowest valley.\nThe blood that gives me strength from day to day,\nIt will never lose its power.\n\n2\nIt soothes my doubts and calms my fears,\nAnd it dries all, all my tears.\nThe blood that gives me strength from day to day,\nIt will never lose its power."
