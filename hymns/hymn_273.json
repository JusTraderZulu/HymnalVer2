    "lyrics": "Master, the tempest is raging!\nThe billows are tossing high!\nThe sky is o'ershadowed\nWith blackness;\nNo shelter or help is nigh:\nHow canst Thou lie asleep,\nWhen each moment\nSo madly is threatening\nA grave in the angry deep?\n\nCHORUS:\n\"The winds and the waves\nShall obey My Will,\nPeace, be still!\"\nWhether the wrath\nOf the storm-tossed sea,\nOr demons, or men,\nOr whatever it be,\nNo water can swallow\nThe ship where lies\nThe Master of ocean,\nAnd Earth and skies;\nThey all shall sweetly\nObey My will;\nPeace, peace, be still!\n\nMaster, with anguish of spirit\nI bow in my grief today;\nThe depths of my sad heart\nAre troubled;\nO waken and save, I pray!\nTorrents of sin and of anguish\nSweep o'er my sinking soul!\nAnd I perish,\nI perish, dear Master;\nO hasten, and take control!\n\nMaster, the terror is over,\nThe elements sweetly rest;\nEarth's sun in the calm lake\nAnd Heaven's within my breast.\nLinger, O blessed Redeemer,\nLeave me alone no more;\nAnd with joy\nI shall make the blest harbour,\nAnd rest on the blissful shore."
