    "lyrics": "On a hill far away\nStood an old rugged cross,\nThe emblem of\nSuffering and shame;\nAnd I love that old cross\nWhere the dearest and best\nFor a world of\nLost sinners was slain.\n\nCHORUS:\nSo I'll cherish\nThe old rugged cross,\nTill my trophies\nAt last I lay down;\nI will cling\nTo the old rugged cross,\nAnd exchange it\nSome day for a crown.\n\nO that old rugged cross,\nSo despised by the world,\nHas a wondrous\nAttraction for me;\nFor the dear Lamb of God\nLeft His glory above\nTo bear it to dark Calvary.\n\nIn the old rugged cross,\nStained with blood so divine,\nA wondrous beauty I see;\nFor 'twas on that old cross\nJesus suffered and died\nTo pardon and sanctify me.\n\nTo the old rugged cross\nI will ever be true,\nIts shame and\nReproach gladly bear;\nThen He'll call me some day\nTo my home far away,\nWhere His glory\nForever I'll share."
