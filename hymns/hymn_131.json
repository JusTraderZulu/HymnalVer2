  "lyrics": "1. Thou, my everlasting portion,\nMore than friend or life to me;\nAll along my pilgrim journey,\nSavior, let me walk with Thee.\n\nRefrain:\nClose to Thee, Close to Thee,\nClose to Thee, Close to Thee,\nAll along this tedious journey,\nSavior, let me walk with Thee.\n\n2. Not for ease or worldly pleasure,\nNor for fame my prayer shall be;\nGladly will I toil and suffer,\nOnly let me walk with Thee. [Refrain]\n\n3. Lead me through the vale of shadows,\nBear me o’er life’s fitful sea,\nThen the gate of life eternal,\nMay I enter, Lord, with Thee."
