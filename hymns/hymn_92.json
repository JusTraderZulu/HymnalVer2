  "lyrics": "Approach, my soul, the mercy seat,\nWhere Jesus answers prayer;\nThere humbly fall before His feet,\nFor none can perish there.\n\nThy promise is my only plea,\nWith this I venture nigh;\nThou callest burdened souls to Thee,\nAnd such, O Lord, am I.\n\nBowed down beneath a load of sin,\nBy Satan sorely pressed,\nBy wars without, and fears within,\nI come to Thee for rest.\n\nBe Thou my Shield and Hiding Place,\nThat, sheltered near Thy side,\nI may my fierce accuser face,\nAnd tell him, Thou hast died.\n\nO wondrous love! to bleed and die,\nTo bear the cross and shame,\nThat guilty sinners, such as I,\nMight plead Thy gracious name."
