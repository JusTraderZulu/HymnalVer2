    "lyrics": "Sound the battle cry!\nSee, the foe is nigh!\nRaise the standard high\nFor the Lord;\nGird your armor on,\nStand firm, everyone;\nRest your cause upon His Holy Word.\n\nCHORUS:\nRouse, then, soldiers,\nRally round the banner!\nReady, steady, pass the word along;\nOnward, forward, shout aloud, \"Hosanna!\"\nChrist is Captain of the mighty throng.\n\nStrong to meet the foe,\nMarching on we go,\nWhile our cause, we know,\nMust prevail;\nShield and banner bright,\nGleaming in the light,\nBattling for the right,\nWe ne'er can fail.\n\nO Thou God of all,\nHear us when we call;\nHelp us, one and all,\nBy Thy grace;\nWhen the battle's done,\nAnd the victory won,\nMay we wear the crown\nBefore Thy face."
