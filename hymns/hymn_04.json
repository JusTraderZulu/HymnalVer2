O salvation!\nThe joyful sound proclaim,\nTill earth's remotest nation\nHas learned Messiah's name.\n\nWaft, waft, ye winds, His story,\nAnd you, ye waters, roll,\nTill, like a sea of glory,\nIt spreads from pole to pole,\nTill o'er our ransomed nature,\nThe Lamb for sinners slain,\nRedeemer, King, Creator,\nIn bliss returns to reign.",
