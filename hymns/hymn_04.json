  "lowercaseLyrics": "from greenland's icy mountains,\nfrom india's coral strand,\nwhere africa's sunny fountains\nroll down their golden sand,\nfrom many an ancient river,\nfrom many a palmy plain,\nthey call us to deliver\ntheir land from error's chain.\n\nwhat though the spicy breezes,\nblow soft o'er ceylon's isle,\nthough every prospect pleases\nand only man is vile;\nin vain with lavish kindness\nthe gifts of god are strown,\nthe heathen, in his blindness,\nbows down to wood and stone.\n\nshall we, whose souls are lighted\nwith wisdom from on high,\nshall we, to men benighted,\nthe lamp of life deny?\nsalvation! o salvation!\nthe joyful sound proclaim,\ntill earth's remotest nation\nhas learned messiah's name.\n\nwaft, waft, ye winds, his story,\nand you, ye waters, roll,\ntill, like a sea of glory,\nit spreads from pole to pole,\ntill o'er our ransomed nature,\nthe lamb for sinners slain,\nredeemer, king, creator,\nin bliss returns to reign."
