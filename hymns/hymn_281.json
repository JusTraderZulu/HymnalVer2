"lyrics": "On Jordan's bank the Baptist's cry,\nAnnounces that the Lord is nigh,\nAwake, and hearken, for He brings,\nGlad tidings of the King of Kings.\n\nThen cleansed be every breast from sin,\nMake straight the way for God within,\nPrepare we in our hearts a home,\nWhere such a mighty guest may come.\n\nFor Thou art our Salvation, Lord,\nOur refuge, and our great reward;\nWithout Thy grace we waste away,\nLike flowers that wither and decay.\n\nTo heal the sick stretch out Thine hand,\nAnd bid the fallen sinner stand,\nShine forth, and let Thy light restore,\nEarth's own true loveliness once more.\n\nAll praise, Eternal Son, to Thee,\nWhose advent doth Thy people free,\nWhom with the Father we adore,\nAnd Holy Ghost for evermore."
