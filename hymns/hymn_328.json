    "lyrics": "Hark, my soul! it is the Lord:\n'Tis Thy Saviour, hear His word;\nJesus speaks, and speaks to Thee,\nSay, poor sinner, Lovest Thou me?\n\nI delivered Thee when bound,\nAnd, when bleeding, Healed Thy wound;\nSought Thee wandering, Set Thee right,\nTurn'd Thy darkness into light.\n\nCan a woman's tender care Cease towards the child she bare?\nYes, she may forgetful be,\nYet will I remember Thee.\n\nMine is an unchanging love,\nHigher than the heights above,\nDeeper than the depths beneath,\nFree and faithful strong as death.\n\nThou shalt see my glory soon,\nWhen the work of grace is done;\nPartner of My Throne shalt be;\nSay, poor sinner lovest Thou me.\n\nLord, it is my chief complaint\nThat my love is weak and faint;\nYet I love Thee, and adore;\nO for grace to love Thee more."
