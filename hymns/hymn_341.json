    "lyrics": "Tho’ shadows deepen,\nAnd my heart bleeds,\nI will not question\nThe way He leads,\nThis side of Heaven,\nWe know in part\nI will not question\nA broken heart\n\nChorus\nWe’ll talk it over in the bye and bye\nWe’ll talk it over, my Lord and I\nI’ll ask the reasons He’ll tell me why,\nWhen we talk it over\nIn the bye and bye\n\nI’ll trust His leading.\nHe’ll never fail,\nThro’ darkest tunnels\nOr misty vale,\nObey His bidding\nAnd faithful be,\nTho’ only one step\nAhead I see\n\nI’ll hide my heartache\nBehind a smile,\nAnd wait for reasons\nTill after while, and tho’ He try me\nI know I’ll find\nThat all my burdens are silver lined"
