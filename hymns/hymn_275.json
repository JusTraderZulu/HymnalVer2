    "lyrics": "Sun of my soul,\nThou Saviour dear,\nIt is not night\nlf Thou be near;\nO may no Earth born cloud arise\nTo hide Thee from\nThy servant's eyes.\n\nWhen the soft dews\nOf kindly sleep\nMy wearied eyelids\nGently steep,\nBe my last thought,\nHow sweet to rest\nFor ever on\nMy Saviour's breast.\n\n'Abide with me\nFrom morn till eve,\nFor without Thee\nI cannot live;\nAbide with me\nWhen night is nigh,\nFor without Thee\nI dare not die.\n\nlf some poor wand'ring\nChild of Thine\nHave spurn'd today\nThe voice Divine,\nNow, Lord,\nThe gracious work begin;\nLet him no more\nLie down in sin.\n\nWatched by the sick;\nEnrich the poor\nWith blessings from\nThy boundless store;\nBe every mourner's sleep tonight\nLike infant's slumbers,\nPure and light.\n\nCome near\nAnd bless us when we wake,\nEre through the world\nOur way we take;\nTill in the ocean of Thy Love\nWe lose ourselves\nIn Heav'n above."
