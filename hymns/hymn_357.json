    "lyrics": "The voice that breathed o'er Eden,\nThat earliest wedding day,\nThe primal marriage blessing,\nIt hath not pass'd away.\n\nStill in the pure espousal\nOf Christian man and maid\nThe Holy Three are with us,\nThe threefold grace is said.\n\nFor dower of blessed children,\nFor love and faith's sweet sake,\nFor high mysterious union\nWhich nought on Earth may break.\n\nBe present awful Father\nTo give away this bride,\nAs Eve Thou gavest to Adam\nOut of His own pierced side.\n\nBe present, Son of Mary\nTo join their loving hands,\nAs Thou didst bind two natures\nIn Thine eternal bands.\n\nBe present, Holiest Spirit,\nTo bless them as they kneel,\nAs Thou for Christ the Bridegroom\nThe Heavenly spouse dost seal.\n\nO spread Thy pure wing o'er them!\nLet no ill power find place,\nWhen onward to Thine altar,\nThe hallowed path they trace.\n\nTo cast their crowns before Thee.\nIn perfect sacrifice,\nTill to the home of gladness\nWith Christ's own bride they rise."
