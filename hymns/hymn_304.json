    "lyrics": "Great God, What do I see and hear?\nThe end of things created:\nThe judge of all men doth appear\nOn clouds of glory seated;\nThe trumpet sounds,\nThe graves restore,\nThe dead which they Contain'd before\nPrepare, my soul, to meet Him.\n\nThe dead in Christ\nAre first to rise\nAt that last trumpet's sounding;\nCaught up to meet Him\nIn the skies,\nWith joy their Lord surrounding;\nNo gloomy fears\nTheir souls dismay;\nHis presence sheds eternal day\nOn those prepared to meet Him.\n\nThe ungodly, fill'd\nWith guilty fears,\nBehold His wrath prevailing;\nIn woe they rise,\nBut all their tears\nAnd sighs are unavailing:\nThe day of grace is past and gone;\nTrembling they stand\nBefore His Throne,\nAll unprepared to meet Him.\n\nGreat judge\nTo Thee our prayers we pour,\nIn deep abasement bending;\nO shield us through\nThat last dread hour,\nThy wondrous love extending;\nMay we, in this our trial day,\nWith faithful hearts Thy word obey,\nAnd thus prepare to meet Thee."
