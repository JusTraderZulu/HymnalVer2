    "lyrics": "The first Noel the Angel did say\nWas to certain poor shepherds\nIn fields as they lay\nIn fields where they\nLay keeping their sheep\nOn a cold winter's night\nThat was so deep.\n\nCHORUS:\nNoel, Noel, Noel, Noel,\nBorn is the King of Israel.\n\nAnd by the light of that same star\nThree wise men came\nFrom country far to seek for a King\nWas their intent,\nAnd to follow the star,\nWherever it went.\n\nThis star drew nigh\nTo the North West,\nO'er Bethlehem it took its rest\nAnd there it did\nBoth stop and stay\nRight over the place\nWhere Jesus lay.\n\nThen entered in\nThose wise men three,\nFell fervently upon their knee\nAnd offered there\nIn His presence,\nTheir gold and myrrh\nAnd frankincense."
