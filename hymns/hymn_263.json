    "lyrics": "O safe to the Rock\nThat is higher than I\nMy soul in its conflicts\nAnd sorrows would fly,\nSo sinful, so weary\nThine, Thine would I be:\nThou blest \"Rock of Ages,\"\nI'm hiding in Thee.\n\nCHORUS:\nHiding in Thee\nHiding in Thee,\nThou blest \"Rock of Ages,\"\nI'm hiding in Thee.\n\nIn the calm of the noontide,\nIn sorrow's lone hour,\nIn times when temptation\nCasts o'er me its power,\nIn the tempests of life,\nOn its wide, heaving sea,\nThou blest \"Rock of Ages,\"\nI'm hiding in Thee.\n\nHow oft in the conflict,\nWhen pressed by the foe,\nI have fled to my Refuge\nAnd breathed out my woe;\nHow often, when trials\nLike sea billows roll,\nHave I hidden in Thee,\nO Thou Rock of my soul."
