Sometimes it causes me\nTo tremble, tremble, tremble.\nWere you there\nWhen they nailed Him to the tree?\n\n3. Were you there\nWhen they pierced Him in the side?\nWere you there\nWhen they pierced Him in the side?\nOh! Sometimes it causes me\nTo tremble, tremble, tremble.\nWere you there\nWhen they pierced Him in the side?\n\n4.

Sometimes I feel like\nShouting 'Glory, glory, glory!'\nWere you there\nWhen He rose up from the dead?"
