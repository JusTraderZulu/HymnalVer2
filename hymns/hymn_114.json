    "lyrics": "O spread the tidings round\nWherever man is found\nWherever human hearts\nAnd human woes abound\nLet every Christian tongue\nProclaim the joyful sound\nThe Comforter has come.\n\nCHORUS:\nThe Comforter has come,\nThe Comforter has come,\nThe Holy Ghost from Heaven,\nThe Father's promise given\nO spread the tidings round,\nWherever man is found\nThe Comforter has come.\n\nThe long long night is past\nThe morning breaks at last\nAnd hushed the dreadful wail\nAnd fury of the blast\nAs o'er the golden hills\nThe day advances fast\nThe Comforter has come.\n\nLo the great King of Kings\nWith healing in His wings\nTo every captive soul\nA full deliverance bring\nAnd through the vacant cells\nThe song of triumph ring\nThe Comforter has come.\n\nO boundless Love divine\nHow shall this tongue of mine\nTo wond'ring mortals tell\nThe matchless grace divine\nThat I a child of hell\nShould in His image shine\nThe Comforter has come."
