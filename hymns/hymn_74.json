    "lyrics": "How solemn are the words\nAnd yet to faith how plain,\nWhich Jesus uttered while on Earth,\n\"Ye must be born again.\"\n\n\"Ye must be born again\"\nFor so hath God decreed;\nNo reformation will suffice,\n'Tis life poor sinners need.\n\n\"Ye must be born again\"\nAnd life in Christ must have;\nIn vain the soul may elsewhere go,\n'Tis He alone can save.\n\n\"Ye must be born again\"\nOh, never enter Heaven;\n'Tis only blood-washed ones are there,\nThe ransomed and forgiven."
