Rejoice! Immanuel\nshall come to you, O Israel.\n\n2 O come, O Wisdom from on high,\nwho ordered all things mightily;\nto us the path of knowledge show\nand teach us in its ways to go.\nRefrain\n\n3 O come, O come, great Lord of\nmight,\nwho to your tribes on Sinai's height\nin ancient times did give the law\nin cloud and majesty and awe.\nRefrain\n4 O come, O Branch of Jesse's stem,\nunto your own and rescue them!\nFrom depths of hell your people\nsave,\nand give them victory o'er the grave.\nRefrain"
