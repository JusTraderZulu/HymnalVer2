    "lyrics": "\"Lord, when thy kingdom comes, remember me,\" Thus spake the dying lips to dying Ears;\nOf faith, which in that darkest hour could see The promised glory of the far-off years.\n\nNo kingly sign declares that glory now,\nNo ray of hope lights up that awful hour;\nA thorny crown surrounds the bleeding brow,\nThe hands are stretch'd in weakness, not in power.\n\nYet hear the Word the dying Saviour saith, \"Thou too shall rest in Paradise to-day,\"\nO Words of love to answer words of faith, O Words of hope for those who live to pray.\n\nLord, when with dying lips my prayer is said, Grant that in faith Thy kingdom I may see;\nAnd, thinking on thy cross and bleeding Head, May breathe my parting words. \"Remember me.\"\n\nRemember me, but not my shame or sin;\nThy cleansing Blood hath wash'd them all away;\nThy precious death for me did pardon win;\nThy Blood redeem'd me in that awful day.\n\nRemember me; yet how canst Thou forget\nWhat pain and anguish I have caused Thee,\nThe Cross, the Agony, the Bloody sweat,\nAnd all the sorrow Thou didst bear for me?\n\nRemember me; and ere I pass away\nSpeak Thou th'assuring Word that sets us free,\nAnd make Thy promise to my heart, \"To-day Thou too shalt rest in Paradise with me.\""
