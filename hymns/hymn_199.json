    "lyrics": "1. Morning has broken like the first morning;\\nBlackbird has spoken like the first bird.\\nPraise for the singing, praise for the morning,\\nPraise for them springing fresh from the Word.\\n\\n2. Sweet the rain's new‑fall sunlit from Heaven,\\nLike the first dew‑fall on the first grass.\\nPraise for the sweetness of the wet garden,\\nSprung in completeness where His feet pass.\\n\\n3. Mine is the sunlight, mine is the morning,\\nBorn of the One Light Eden saw play.\\nPraise with elation, praise every morning—\\nGod's re‑creation of the new day."
