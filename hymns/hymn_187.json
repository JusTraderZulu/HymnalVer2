The God of Abraham praise!\\n   Who reigns enthroned above,\\n   Ancient of everlasting days,\\n   And God of love!\\n   Jehovah, great I AM!\\n   By earth and Heaven confess’d;\\n   I bow and bless the sacred Name,\\n   For ever blest.\\n\\n2.  The God of Abraham praise!\\n   At whose supreme command\\n   From earth I rise, and seek the joys\\n   At His right hand;\\n   I all on earth forsake—\\n   Its wisdom, fame, and power—\\n   And Him my only portion make,\\n   My shield and tower.\\n\\n3.  The God of Abraham praise!\\n   Whose all‑sufficient grace\\n   Shall guide me all my happy days,\\n   In all my ways;\\n   He calls a worm His friend!\\n   He calls Himself my God!\\n   And He shall save me to the end,\\n   Through Jesus’ blood.\\n\\n4.  He by Himself hath sworn—\\n   I on His oath depend—\\n   I shall, on eagles’ wings upborne,\\n   To Heaven ascend;\\n   I shall behold His face,\\n   I shall His power adore,\\n   And sing the wonders of His grace\\n   For evermore.\\n\\n5.  The whole triumphant host\\n   Give thanks to God on high;\\n   “Hail, Father, Son and Holy Ghost!”\\n   They ever cry:\\n   Hail! Abraham’s God and mine!\\n   I join the Heavenly lays;\\n   All might and majesty are Thine,\\n   And endless praise.\""
