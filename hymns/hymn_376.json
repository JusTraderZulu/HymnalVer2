Hark! the herald Angels sing,\nGlory to the new born King;\nPeace on Earth and mercy mild,\nGod and sinners reconciled,\nJoyful all ye nations rise,\nJoin the triumph of the skies,\nWith the Angelic host proclaim,\nChrist is born in Bethlehem,\nHark! the herald Angels sing,\nGlory to the new born King.\n\n2. Christ by highest Heaven adored;\nChrist, the everlasting Lord:\nLate in time behold Him come,\nOffspring of a virgin's womb.\nVeiled in flesh the Godhead see,\nHail the incarnate deity!\nPleased as man with man to dwell,\nJesus our Immanuel\nHark! the Herald Angels sing,\nGlory to the new born King.\n\n3. Hail the Heaven born Prince of Peace,\nHail the son of righteousness,\nLight and life to all He brings;\nRisen with healing in His wings\nMild He lays His glory by,\nBorn that man no more may die,\nBorn to raise the sons of Earth,\nBorn to give them second birth,\nHark! the herald Angels sing,\nGlory to the new born King."
