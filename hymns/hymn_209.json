    "lyrics": "Jerusalem, my happy home!\nName ever dear to me;\nWhen shall my labors have an end,\nIn joy, and peace, and thee?\n\nWhen shall these eyes thy heaven built walls\nAnd pearly gates behold?\nThy bulwarks, with salvation strong,\nAnd streets of shining gold?\n\nApostles, martyrs, prophets there\nAround my Savior stand;\nAnd soon my friends in Christ below\nWill join the glorious band.\n\nJerusalem, my happy home!\nMy soul still pants for thee;\nThen shall my labors have an end,\nWhen I thy joys shall see.\n\nO Christ do Thou my soul prepare\nFor that bright home of love;\nThat I may see Thee and adore,\nWith all Thy saints above.\n\nBonus:\n\nThere happier bowers than Eden’s bloom,\nNor sin nor sorrow know:\nBlest seats, through rude and stormy scenes,\nI onward press to you.\n\nWhy should I shrink at pain and woe?\nOr feel at death dismay?\nI’ve Canaan’s goodly land in view,\nAnd realms of endless day."
