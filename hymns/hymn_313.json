    "lyrics": "Sowing in the morning,\nSowing seeds of kindness\nSowing in the noontide\nAnd the dewy eve,\nWaiting for the harvest\nAnd the time of reaping\nWe shall come rejoicing,\nBringing in the sheaves.\n\nCHORUS:\nBringing in the sheaves,\nBringing in the sheaves,\nWe shall come rejoicing,\nBringing in the sheaves.\n\nSowing in the sunshine,\nSowing in the shadows,\nFearing neither clouds\nNor winter's chilling breeze;\nBy and by the harvest\nAnd the labour ended\nWe shall come rejoicing,\nBringing in the sheaves.\n\nGo then ever weeping,\nSowing for the Master,\nThough the loss sustained\nOur Spirit often grieves;\nWhen our weeping's over\nHe will bid us welcome\nWe shall come rejoicing,\nBringing in the sheaves."
