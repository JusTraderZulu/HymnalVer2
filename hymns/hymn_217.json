  "lyrics": "1. Have Thine own way, Lord!\nHave Thine own way!\nThou art the potter,\nI am the clay.\nMold me and make me\nafter Thy will,\nwhile I am waiting,\nyielded and still.\n\n2. Have Thine own way, Lord!\nHave Thine own way!\nSearch me and try me,\nSavior today!\nWash me just now, Lord,\nwash me just now,\nas in Thy presence\nhumbly I bow.\n\n3. Have Thine own way, Lord!\nHave Thine own way!\nWounded and weary,\nhelp me I pray!\nPower, all power,\nsurely is Thine!\nTouch me and heal me,\nSavior divine!\n\n4. Have Thine own way, Lord!\nHave Thine own way!\nHold o'er my being\nabsolute sway.\nFill with Thy Spirit\ntill all shall see\nChrist only, always,\nliving in me!"
