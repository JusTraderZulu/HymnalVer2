He's got the wind and the rain\nIn His hands,\nHe's got the wind and the rain\nIn His hands,\nHe's got the wind and the rain\nIn His hands,\nHe's got the whole world\nIn His hands.\n\n3. He's got the tiny little baby\nIn His hands,\nHe's got the tiny little baby\nIn His hands,\nHe's got the tiny little baby\nIn His hands,\nHe's got the whole world\nIn His hands.\n\n4. He's got you and me, brother,\nIn His hands,\nHe's got you and me, sister,\nIn His hands,\nHe's got you and me, brother,\nIn His hands,\nHe's got the whole world\nIn His hands."
