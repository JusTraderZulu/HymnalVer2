    "lyrics": "Try us, O God\nAnd search the ground,\nOf every sinful heart,\nWhate'er of sin\nIn us is found,\nO bid it all depart\n\nWhen to the right\nOr left we stray,\nLeave us not comfortless.\nBut guide our feet\nInto the way;\nOf everlasting peace.\n\nHelp us to help\nEach other Lord,\nEach other's cross lo bear,\nLet each His friendly\nAid afford,\nAnd feel His brother's care.\n\nHelp us to build\nEach other up,\nOur little stock improve,\nincrease our faith,\nConfirm our hope,\nAnd perfect us in love.\n\nUp into Thee,\nOur living head,\nLet us in all things grow\nTill Thou hast made us\nFree indeed,\nAnd spotless here below.\n\nThen, when the mighty work\nIs wrought,\nReceive Thy ready bride,\nGive us in Heaven a happy lot.\nWith all the sanctified."
