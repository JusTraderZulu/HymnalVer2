I've wandered\nFar away from God,\nNow I'm coming home;\nThe paths of sin\nToo long I've trod,\nLord, I'm coming home.\n\nCHORUS:\nComing home,\nComing home,\nNever more to roam;\nOpen wide Thine arms of love—\nLord, I'm coming home.\n\n2. I've wasted many\nPrecious years,\nNow I'm coming home;\nI now repent\nWith bitter tears,\nLord, I'm coming home.\n\n3. I'm tired of sin\nAnd straying, Lord,\nNow I'm coming home;\nI'll trust Thy love,\nBelieve Thy word,\nLord, I'm coming home.\n\n4. My soul is sick,\nMy heart is sore,\nNow I'm coming home;\nMy strength renew,\nMy hope restore,\nLord, I'm coming home."
