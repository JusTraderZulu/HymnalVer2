  "lyrics": "Before Jehovah's awful throne,\nYe nations, bow with Sacred joy,\nKnow that the Lord is God alone,\nHe can create, and He destroy.\n\nHis sovereign power, without our aid,\nMade us of clay, and formed us men;\nAnd when like wandering sheep we strayed,\nHe brought us to His fold again.\n\nWe'll crowd Thy gates with thankful songs;\nHigh as the Heavens our voices raise;\nAnd Earth, with her ten thousand tongues,\nShall fill Thy courts with sounding praise.\n\nWide as the world is Thy command,\nVast as eternity Thy love;\nFirm as a rock Thy truth must stand,\nWhen rolling years shall cease to move."
