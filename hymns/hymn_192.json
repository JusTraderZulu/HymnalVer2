    "lyrics": "1. Walk in the light, so shalt thou know\nThat fellowship of love,\nHis Spirit only can bestow\nWho reigns in light above.\n\n2. Walk in the light, and thou shalt find\nThy heart made truly His,\nWho dwells in cloudless light enshrined,\nIn whom no darkness is.\n\n3. Walk in the light, and sin abhorred\nShall not defile again;\nThe blood of Jesus Christ the Lord\nShall cleanse from every stain.\n\n4. Walk in the light, and thou shalt own\nThy darkness passed away,\nBecause that light hath on thee shone\nIn which is perfect day.\n\n5. Walk in the light, and even the tomb\nNo fearful shade shall wear;\nGlory shall chase away its gloom,\nFor Christ hath conquered there.\n\n6. Walk in the light, thy path shall be\nPeaceful, serene, and bright;\nFor God, by grace, shall dwell in thee,\nAnd God Himself is light."
