    "lyrics": "In shady, green pastures,\nSo rich and so sweet,\nGod leads His dear children along;\nWhere the water's cool flow\nBathes the weary ones feet,\nGod leads His dear children along.\n\nCHORUS:\nSome through the waters,\nSome through the flood,\nSome through the fire,\nBut all through the blood;\nSome through great sorrow,\nBut God gives a song,\nIn the night season\nAnd all day long.\n\nSome time on the mount\nWhere the sun shine so bright,\nGod leads His dear children along;\nSometime in the valley,\nIn the darkest of night,\nGod leads His dear children along.\n\nTho' sorrows befall us,\nAnd Satan oppose,\nGod leads His dear children along;\nThrough grace we can conquer,\nDefeat all our foes,\nGod leads His dear children along.\n\nAway from the mire,\nAnd away from the clay,\nGod leads His dear children along;\nAway up in glory,\nEternity's day,\nGod leads His dear children along."
