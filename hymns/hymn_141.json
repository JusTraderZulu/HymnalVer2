Are you trusting Jesus\nAll along the way?\nDoes He grow more precious\nTo your heart each day?\nAre you His disciple\nTest His word and see?\nHe will give the Spirit\nMore abundantly.\n\nRefrain:\nMore abundantly,\nMore abundantly,\n'That they might have life\nAnd more abundantly';\nMore abundantly,\nMore abundantly,\n'That they might have life\nAnd more abundantly.'\n\n2. For His matchless favour\nMagnify the name\nOf our gracious Saviour\nWho from glory came;\nLet the saints adore Him\nFor this wondrous word,\nSealing our redemption\nThrough the crimson flood.\n\nRefrain\n\n3. Come to Him believing,\nHearken to His call;\nAll from Him receiving,\nYield to Him your all;\nJesus will accept you\nWhen to Him you flee;\nHe will grant His blessing\nMore abundantly."
