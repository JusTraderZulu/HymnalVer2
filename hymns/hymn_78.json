    "lyrics": "Praise Him! Praise Him!\nJesus, our blessed Redeemer!\nSing, O Earth, His wonderful love proclaim!\nHail Him! Hail Him!\nHighest Archangels in glory;\nStrength and honor give to His holy name!\nLike a shepherd Jesus will guard His children,\nIn His arms He carries them all day long;\n\nCHORUS:\nPraise Him! Praise Him!\nTell of His excellent greatness,\nPraise Him! Praise Him!\nEver in joyful song.\n\nPraise Him! Praise Him!\nJesus, our blessed Redeemer!\nFor our sins, He suffered and bled and died;\nHe, our Rock, our hope of eternal salvation,\nHail Him! Hail Him!\nJesus the Crucified.\nSound His praises!\nJesus who bore our sorrows,\nLove unbounded, wonderful, deep, and strong.\n\nPraise Him! Praise Him!\nJesus, our blessed Redeemer!\nHeavenly portals loud with hosannas ring!\nJesus, Saviour, reigneth forever and ever;\nCrown Him! Crown Him!\nProphet, and Priest, and King!\nChrist is coming!\nOver the world victorious,\nPower and glory unto the Lord belong."
