    "lyrics": "1\nI don't know about tomorrow,\nI just live from day to day.\nI don't borrow from its sunshine,\nFor its skies may turn to gray.\nI don't worry o'er the future,\nFor I know what Jesus said,\nAnd today I'll walk beside Him,\nFor He knows what is ahead.\n\nRefrain:\nMany things about tomorrow,\nI don't seem to understand;\nBut I know who holds tomorrow,\nAnd I know who holds my hand.\n\n2\nEvery step is getting brighter,\nAs the golden stairs I climb;\nEvery burden's getting lighter;\nEvery cloud is silver lined.\nThere the sun is always shining,\nThere no tear will dim the eye,\nAt the ending of the rainbow,\nWhere the mountains touch the sky.\n\n3\nI don't know about tomorrow,\nIt may bring me poverty;\nBut the one who feeds the sparrow,\nIs the one who stands by me.\nAnd the path that be my portion,\nMay be through the flame or flood,\nBut His presence goes before me,\nAnd I'm covered with His blood."
