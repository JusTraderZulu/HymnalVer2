    "lyrics": "1\nGod sent his son;\nthey called him Jesus;\nhe came to love, heal and forgive;\nhe lived and died to buy my pardon;\nan empty grave is there\nto prove my Saviour lives.\n\nChorus:\nBecause he lives I can face tomorrow;\nbecause he lives all fear is gone;\nbecause I know he holds the future,\nand life is worth the living\njust because he lives.\n\n2\nHow sweet to hold a new-born baby,\nand feel the pride and joy he gives;\nbut greater still the calm assurance,\nthis child can face uncertain days\nbecause he lives.\n\n3\nAnd then one day I’ll cross the river;\nI’ll fight life’s final war with pain;\nand then as death gives way to victory,\nI’ll see the lights of glory\nand I’ll know he lives."
