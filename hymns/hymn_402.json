    "lyrics": "COME, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire,\nAnd lighten with celestial fire;\nThou the anointing Spirit art,\nWho dost Thy sevenfold gifts impart:\n\nThy blessed unction from above\nIs comfort, life, and fire of love;\nEnable with perpetual light\nThe dullness of our blinded sight:\n\nAnoint and cheer our soiled face\nWith the abundance of Thy grace:\nKeep far our foes, give peace at home;\nWhere Thou art Guide no ill can come.\n\nTeach us to know the Father, Son,\nAnd Thee, of Both, to be but One,\nThat through the ages all along\nThis may be our endless song,\n\nPraise to Thy eternal merit,\nFather, Son, and Holy Spirit."
