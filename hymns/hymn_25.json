  "lyrics": "How sweet the name\nOf Jesus sounds\nIn a believer's ear!\nIt soothes His sorrows,\nHeals His wounds,\nAnd drives away His fear.\n\nIt makes the wounded\nSpirit whole,\nAnd calms the troubled breast;\n'Tis manna to the hungry soul,\nAnd to the weary rest.\n\nDear name! the Rock\nOn which I build,\nMy shield, and hiding-place,\nMy never-failing treasury filled,\nWith boundless stores of grace!\n\nJesus, my Shepherd,\nSavior, Friend,\nMy Prophet, Priest, and King,\nMy Lord, my Life\nMy way, my end,\nAccept the praise I bring.\n\nI would Thy boundless\nLove proclaim,\nWith every fleeting breath,\nSo shall the music of Thy name\nRefresh my soul in death."
