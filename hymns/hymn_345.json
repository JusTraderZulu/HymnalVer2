    "lyrics": "See Israelâ€™s gentle Shepherd stand\nWith all engaging charms;\nHark how He calls the tender lambs,\nAnd folds them in His arms!\n\nPermit them to approach; He cries,\nNor scorn their humble name;\nFor 'twas to bless\nSuch souls as these\nThe Lord of Angels came.\n\nWe bring them, Lord,\nIn thankful hands,\nAnd yield them up to Thee;\nJoyful that we ourselves are Thine,\nThine let our children be."
