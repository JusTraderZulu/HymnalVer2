    "lyrics": "1 Amazing grace (how sweet the sound)\nthat saved a wretch like me!\nI once was lost, but now am found,\nwas blind, but now I see.\n\n2 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,\nand grace my fears relieved;\nhow precious did that grace appear\nthe hour I first believed!\n\n3 Through many dangers, toils and snares\nI have already come:\n'tis grace has brought me safe thus far,\nand grace will lead me home.\n\n4 The Lord has promised good to me,\nhis word my hope secures;\nhe will my shield and portion be\nas long as life endures.\n\n5 Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail,\nand mortal life shall cease:\nI shall possess, within the veil,\na life of joy and peace.\n\n6 The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,\nthe sun forbear to shine;\nbut God, who called me here below,\nwill be forever mine."
