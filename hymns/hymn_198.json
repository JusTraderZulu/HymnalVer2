    "lyrics": "1. Shall we gather at the river, where bright angel feet have trod,\\nWith its crystal tide for ever flowing by the throne of God?\\n\\nCHORUS:\\nYes, we'll gather at the river, the beautiful, the beautiful river;\\nGather with the saints at the river that flows by the throne of God.\\n\\n2. On the margin of the river, washing up its silver spray,\\nWe shall walk and worship ever, all the happy golden day.\\n\\n3. Ere we reach the shining river, lay we every burden down;\\nGrace our spirits will deliver and provide a robe and crown.\\n\\n4. At the smiling of the river, mirror of the Saviour's face,\\nSaints whom death will never sever raise their songs of saving grace.\\n\\n5. Soon we'll reach the silver river, soon our pilgrimage will cease;\\nSoon our happy hearts will quiver with the melody of peace."
