    "lyrics": "I know not why God's wondrous grace\nTo me He hath made known,\nNor why, unworthy, Christ in love\nRedeemed me for His own.\n\nCHORUS:\nBut I know whom I have believed,\nAnd am persuaded that He is able\nTo keep that which I've committed\nUnto Him against that day.\n\nI know not how this saving faith\nTo me He did impart,\nNor how believing in His word\nWrought peace within my heart.\n\nI know not how the Spirit moves,\nConvincing men of sin,\nRevealing Jesus thru the Word,\nCreating faith in Him.\n\nI know not when my Lord may come,\nAt night or noonday fair,\nNor if I'll walk the vale with Him\nOr meet Him in the air."
