      "bio": "Edward Perronet was an English hymnwriter and clergyman of the Church of England. He is best known for writing the famous hymn 'All Hail the Power of Jesus' Name'. Perronet was a close associate of John and Charles Wesley and George Whitefield, leaders of the early Methodist movement. Despite his association with the Wesleys, Perronet occasionally had differences with them regarding the administration of sacraments by lay preachers. Eventually, he departed from the Methodist movement to minister within the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion and later led an independent congregation. Throughout his life, Perronet published a number of hymns and poems, leaving a lasting legacy through his contributions to Christian hymnody."
