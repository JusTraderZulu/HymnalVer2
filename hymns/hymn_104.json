    "lyrics": "Now the day is over,\nNight is drawing nigh,\nShadows of the evening\nSteal across the sky.\n\nJesus, give the weary\nCalm and sweet repose;\nWith Thy tenderest blessing\nMay our eyelids close.\n\nThrough the long night-watches\nMay Thine Angels spread\nTheir white wings above us,\nWatching round each bed.\n\nWhen the morning wakens,\nThen may I arise,\nPure, and fresh, and sinless\nIn Thy Holy eyes,\n\nGlory to the Father,\nGlory to the Son,\nAnd to Thee, blest Spirit,\nWhilst all ages run."
