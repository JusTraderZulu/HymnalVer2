    "lyrics": "What a wonderful,\nWonderful Saviour\nWho would die on the cross for me\nFreely shedding His precious life blood\nThat the sinner might be made free.\n\nCHORUS:\nHe was nailed to the cross for me\nHe was nailed to the cross for me\nOn the cross crucified,\nFor me He died\nHe was nailed to the cross for me.\n\nThus He left\nHis Heavenly glory\nTo accomplish His Father's plan\nHe was born of the Virgin Mary\nTook upon Him the form of man.\n\nHe was wounded\nFor our transgressions\nAnd He carried our sorrows too\nHe's the healer of every sickness\nThis He came to the world to do.\n\nSo He gave\nHis life for others\nIn redeeming this world from sin\nAnd He's gone to prepare a mansion\nThat at last we may enter in."
