    "lyrics": "Come to the Saviour,\nMake no delay,\nHere in His word\nHe has shown us the way,\nHere in our midst\nHe's standing today,\nTenderly saying, \"Come.\"\n\nCHORUS:\nJoyful, joyful,\nWill the meeting be,\nWhen from sin our hearts\nAre pure and free,\nAnd we shall gather,\nSaviour, with Thee,\nIn our Eternal home.\n\n\"Suffer the children,\"\nOh, hear His voice,\nLet every heart leap\nForth and rejoice,\nAnd let us freely\nMake Him our choice,\nDo not delay, but come.\n\nThink once again,\nHe's with us today,\nHeed now His blest\nCommand, and obey\nHear now His accents\nTenderly say,\n\"Will you, my children, come?\""
