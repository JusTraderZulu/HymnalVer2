    "lyrics": "Jesus, keep me near the cross,\nThere's a precious fountain,\nFree to all, a healing stream,\nFlows from Calvary's mountain.\n\nCHORUS:\nIn the Cross, in the Cross,\nBe my glory ever,\nTill my raptured soul shall find,\nRest beyond the river.\n\nNear the cross, a trembling soul,\nLove and mercy found me,\nThere the bright and morning star,\nShed its beams around me.\n\nNear the cross; O Lamb of God,\nBring its scenes before me,\nHelp me walk from day to day,\nWith its shadow o'er me.\n\nNear the cross I'll watch and wait,\nHoping, trusting ever,\nTill I reach the golden strand,\nJust beyond the river."
