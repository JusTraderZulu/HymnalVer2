  "lyrics": "When all Thy mercies, O my God,\nMy rising soul surveys,\nTransported with the view, Iâ€™m lost\nIn wonder, love, and praise.\n\nUnnumbered comforts on my soul\nThy tender care bestowed,\nBefore my infant heart conceived\nFrom whom these comforts flowed.\n\nWhen worn with sickness, oft hast Thou,\nWith health renewed my face,\nAnd when in sins and sorrows sunk;\nRevived my soul with grace.\n\nTen thousand thousand precious gifts\nMy daily thanks employ;\nNor is the least a cheerful heart,\nThat tastes those gifts with joy.\n\nThrough every period of my life\nThy goodness I'll pursue;\nAnd after death, in distant worlds,\nThe glorious theme renew.\n\nThrough all eternity, to Thee\nA grateful song I'll raise;\nBut O eternity's too short\nTo utter all Thy praise!"
