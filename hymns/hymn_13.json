    "lyrics": "Ho, my comrades\nSee the signal\nWaving in the sky\nReinforcements\nNow appearing\nVictory is nigh\n\nCHORUS:\nHold the fort\nFor I am coming\nJesus signals still\nWave the answer\nBack to Heaven\nBy Thy grace we will.\n\nSee the mighty\nHost advancing\nSatan leading on\nMighty men\nAround us falling\nCourage almost gone.\n\nSee the glorious\nBanner waving\nHear the trumpet blow\nIn our leader's name\nWe'll triumph\nOver every foe.\n\nFierce and long\nThe battle rages\nBut our help is near\nOnward comes\nOur great commander\nCheer, my comrades, cheer."
