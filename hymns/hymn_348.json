    "lyrics": "When mothers of Salem,\nTheir children brought to Jesus,\nThe stern disciples drove them back\nAnd bade them depart;\nBut Jesus saw them and they fled,\nAnd sweetly smiled and kindly said:\n\"Suffer little children to come unto me\".\n\nFor I will receive them,\nAnd fold them in my bosom\nI'll be a shepherd to those lambs,\nOh, drive them not away,\nFor if their hearts to Me they give they shall with\nMe in glory live,\n\"Suffer little children to come unto me\".\n\nHow kind was our Saviour,\nTo bid those children welcome,\nBut there are many thousands\nWho have never heard His name,\nThe Bible they have never read,\nThey know not that the Saviour said:\n\"Suffer little children To come unto me\".\n\nOh soon may the heathen,\nOf every tribe and nation,\nFulfill Thy blessed word,\nAnd cast their idols all away,\nOh shine upon them from above,\nAnd show Thyself a God of love,\nTeach the little children to come unto Thee."
