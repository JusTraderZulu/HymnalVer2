  "lyrics": "O for a closer walk with God,\nA calm and heavenly frame,\nA light to shine upon the road\nThat leads me to the Lamb!\n\nWhat peaceful hours I once enjoyed!\nHow sweet their memory still\nBut they have left an aching void\nThe world can never fill.\n\nReturn, O Holy Dove, return,\nSweet messenger of rest;\nI hate the sins that made Thee mourn,\nAnd drove Thee from my breast.\n\nThe dearest idol I have known,\nWhate'er that idol be,\nHelp me to tear it from Thy throne,\nAnd worship only Thee.\n\nSo shall my walk be close with God,\nCalm and serene my frame;\nSo purer light shall mark the road\nThat leads me to the Lamb."
