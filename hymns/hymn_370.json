Silent night, Holy night,\nAll is dark, save the light\nYonder where the sweet vigils keep\no'er the babe who in silence sleep\nRest in Heavenly peace,\nRest in Heavenly peace.\n\n3. Silent night, peaceful night,\nDarkness flies all is light;\nShepherds hear the Angels sing,\nAlleluia hail the King,\nChrist the Saviour is born\nJesus the Saviour is born.\n\n4. Silent night, Holy night,\nGuiding star lend Thy light,\nSee the eastern wise men bring gifts\nAnd homage to our King,\nChrist the Saviour is born,\nJesus the Saviour is born.\n\n5. Silent night, Holiest night,\nWondrous star lend Thy light,\nWith the Angels let us sing\nAlleluia to our King,\nChrist the Saviour is born,\nJesus the Saviour is born."
