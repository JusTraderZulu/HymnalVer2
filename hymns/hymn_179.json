    "lyrics": "1. O let us lift our voices, look toward the sky and start to sing;\\nO let us now return His love, just let our voices ring.\\n\\nCHORUS:\\nSometimes Alleluia, sometimes “Praise the Lord,”\\nSometimes gently singing—our hearts in one accord.\\n\\n2. O let our joy be unconfined, let us sing with freedom unrestrained;\\nLet’s take this feeling that we are feeling now outside these walls and let it rain.\\n\\n3. O let us feel His presence, let the sound of praises fill the air;\\nO let us sing the song of Jesus’ love to people everywhere.\\n\\n4. O let the Spirit overflow, as we are filled from head to toe;\\nWe love You, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and we want this world to know."
