      "bio": "Charles Wesley was a leader of the Methodist movement, most widely known for writing over 6,000 hymns. Wesley was born in Epworth, Lincolnshire, England, where his father was rector. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, and formed the 'Holy Club' among his fellow students. After an unsuccessful ministry of a year at Savannah in the Georgia Colony, Wesley returned home and joined the religious revival that was led by his brother John Wesley. He became one of the most prolific hymn writers in history, known for his contributions to the Methodist hymnal and for hymns such as 'Hark! The Herald Angels Sing' and 'Love Divine, All Loves Excelling'."

    "lyrics": "Let Saints on Earth in concert sing\nWith those whose work is done;\nFor all the servants of our King\nIn Heav'n and Earth are one.\n\nOne family, we dwelling Him,\nOne Church, above, beneath;\nThough now divided by the stream,\nThe narrow stream of death.\n\nOne army of the living God,\nTo His command we bow;\nPart of the host\nHave cross'd the flood,\nAnd part are crossing now.\n\nE'en now to their Eternal Home\nThere pass some Spirits blest;\nWhile others to the margin come,\nWaiting their call to rest.\n\nJesu, be Thou our constant guide;\nThen, when the word is given,\nBid Jordan's narrow stream divide,\nAnd bring us safe to Heav'n."
