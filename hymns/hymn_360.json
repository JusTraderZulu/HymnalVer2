    "lyrics": "Blest be the tie that binds,\nOur hearts in Christian love,\nThe fellowship of kindred minds\nIs like to that above.\n\nBefore our Father's throne,\nWe pour our ardent prayers;\nOur fears, our hopes\nOur aims are one,\nOur comforts and our cares.\n\nWe share our mutual woes,\nOur mutual burdens bear;\nAnd often for each other flows,\nThe sympathizing tear.\n\nWhen we asunder part,\nIt gives us inward pain;\nBut we shall still\nBe joined in heart,\nAnd hope to meet again."
