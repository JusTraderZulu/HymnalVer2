    "lyrics": "1\nWhat various hindrances we meet\nIn coming to a mercy seat!\nYet who that knows the worth of prayer\nBut wishes to be often there.\n\n2\nPrayer makes the darkened cloud withdraw;\nPrayer climbs the ladder Jacob saw;\nGives exercise to faith and love,\nBrings every blessing from above.\n\n3\nRestraining prayer, we cease to fight;\nPrayer makes the Christian’s armor bright;\nAnd Satan trembles, when he sees\nThe weakest saint upon his knees.\n\n4\nWhile Moses stood with arms spread wide,\nSuccess was found on Israel's side;\nBut when through weariness they failed,\nThat moment Amalek prevailed.\n\n5\nHave you no words? Ah, think again,\nWords flow apace when you complain,\nAnd fill your fellow-creature’s ear\nWith the sad tale of all your care.\n\n6\nWere half the breath thus vainly spent\nTo heaven in supplication sent,\nYour cheerful song would oftener be,\n'Hear what the Lord has done for me.'\n\n7\nO Lord, increase our faith and love\nThat we may all Thy goodness prove\nAnd gain from Thy exhaustless store\nThe fruits of prayer for evermore."
