    "lyrics": "A wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Lord,\nA wonderful Saviour to me,\nHe hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,\nWhere rivers of pleasure I see.\n\nCHORUS:\nHe hideth my soul\nIn the cleft of the Rock,\nThat shadows a dry thirsty land;\nHe hideth my life\nIn the depths of His love,\nAnd covers me there with His hand.\n\nA wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Lord,\nHe taketh my burden away,\nHe holdeth me up and I shall not be moved,\nHe giveth me strength as my day.\n\nWith numberless blessings each moment He crowns,\nAnd filled with His goodness divine,\nI sing in my rapture, Oh, glory to God\nFor such a Redeemer as mine!\n\nWhen clothed in His brightness, transported I rise\nTo meet Him in clouds of the sky,\nHis perfect salvation, His wonderful love,\nI'll shout â€˜with the millions on high."
