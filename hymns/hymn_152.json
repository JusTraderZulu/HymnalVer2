    "lyrics": "1\nThere’s a blessed time that’s coming, coming soon,\nIt may be evening, morning, or at noon,\nThe wedding of the bride, united with the Groom,\nWe shall see the King when He comes.\n\nChorus:\nWe shall see the King, we shall see the King,\nWe shall see the King when He comes;\nHe is coming in pow’r, we’ll hail the blessed hour,\nWe shall see the King when he comes.\n\n2\nAre you ready should the Savior call today?\nWould Jesus say, 'Well done' or 'Go away'?\n'My home is for the pure, the vile can never stay';\nWe shall see the King when He comes.\n\n3\nOh, my brother, are you ready for the call?\nTo crown your Savior king and Lord of all?\nThe kingdoms of this world shall soon before Him fall,\nWe shall see the King when He comes."
