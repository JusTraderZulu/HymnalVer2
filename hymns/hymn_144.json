    "lyrics": "1\nI stand amazed in the presence\nOf Jesus the Nazarene,\nAnd wonder how He could love me,\nA sinner, condemned, unclean.\n\nChorus:\nOh How marvelous! Oh How wonderful!\nAnd my song shall ever be:\nOh How marvelous! Oh How wonderful!\nIs my Savior’s love for me!\n\n2\nFor me it was in the garden\nHe prayed: “Not My will, but Thine.”\nHe had no tears for His own griefs,\nBut sweat drops of blood for mine.\n\n3\nIn pity angels beheld Him,\nAnd came from the world of light\nTo comfort Him in the sorrows\nHe bore for my soul that night.\n\n4\nHe took my sins and my sorrows,\nHe made them His very own;\nHe bore the burden to Calv’ry,\nAnd suffered and died alone.\n\n5\nWhen with the ransomed in glory\nHis face I at last shall see,\n’Twill be my joy through the ages\nTo sing of His love for me."
