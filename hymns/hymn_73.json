    "lyrics": "I'm pressing on the upward way,\nNew heights I'm gaining every day;\nStill praying as I'm onward bound,\n\"Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.\"\n\nCHORUS:\nLord, lift me up and let me stand\nBy faith, on Heaven's table land;\nA higher plane than I have found,\nLord, plant my feet on higher ground.\n\nMy heart has no desire to stay\nWhere doubts arise and fears dismay;\nTho' some may dwell where these abound,\nMy prayer, my aim, is higher ground.\n\nI want to live above the world,\nTho' Satan's darts at me are hurled;\nFor faith has caught the joyful sound,\nThe song of saints on higher ground.\n\nI want to scale the utmost height\nAnd catch a gleam of glory bright;\nBut still I'll pray till Heav'n I've found,\n\"Lord, lead me on to higher ground.\""
