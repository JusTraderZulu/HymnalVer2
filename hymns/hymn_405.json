    "lyrics": "How pleased and blest was I,\nTo hear the people cry:\nCome, let us seek our God to-day,\nYes, with a cheer-ful zeal\nWe haste to Zion's hill\nAnd there our vows and honours pay.\n\nZion, thrice happy place,\nAdorn'd with wondrous grace\nAnd walls of strength embrace thee round;\nIn thee our tribes appear,\nTo pray and praise and hear\nThe sacred Gospel's joy-ful sound.\n\nThere David's greater Son\nHas fix'd His royal throne,\nHe sits for grace and judgment there:\nHe bids the saint be glad\nHe makes the sinner sad\nAnd humble souls rejoice with fear.\n\nMay peace attend thy gate,\nAnd joy within thee wait\nTo bless the soul of every guest:\nThe man that seeks thy peace,\nAnd wishes thine increase\nA thousand blessings on him rest.\n\nMy tongue repeats her vows,\nPeace to this sacred house,\nFor there my friends and kindred dwell;\nAnd since my glorious God\nMakes thee His blest abode,\nMy soul shall ever love thee well."
