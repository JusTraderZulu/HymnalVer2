    "lyrics": "Love divine, all loves excelling,\nJoy of Heaven to earth come down;\nFix in us Thy humble dwelling;\nAll Thy faithful mercies crown!\nJesus, Thou art all compassion,\nPure, unbounded love Thou art;\nVisit us with Thy salvation;\nEnter every trembling heart.\n\nBreathe, O breathe Thy loving Spirit\nInto every troubled breast!\nLet us all in Thee inherit;\nLet us find the promised rest.\nTake away our love of sinning;\nAlpha and Omega be;\nEnd of faith, as its Beginning,\nSet our hearts at liberty.\n\nCome, Almighty to deliver,\nLet us all Thy life receive;\nSuddenly return, and never,\nNever more Thy temples leave.\nThee we would be always blessing,\nServe Thee as Thy hosts above,\nPray, and praise Thee without ceasing,\nGlory in Thy perfect love.\n\nFinish, then, Thy new creation;\nPure and spotless let us be;\nLet us see Thy great salvation\nPerfectly restored in Thee:\nChanged from glory into glory,\nTill in Heaven we take our place,\nTill we cast our crowns before Thee,\nLost in wonder, love, and praise."
