    "lyrics": "1. New every morning is the love,\nOur wakening and uprising prove\nThrough sleep and darkness\nSafely brought,\nRestored to life\nAnd power and thought.\n\n2. New mercies each returning day\nHover around us while we pray\nNew perils past, new sins forgiven\nNew thoughts of God\nNew hopes of Heaven.\n\n3. If on our daily course our mind\nBe set to hallow all we find\nNew treasures still\nOf countless price,\nGod will provide for sacrifice.\n\n4. Old friends, old scenes\nWill lovelier be\nAs more of Heaven in each we see,\nSome softening gleam\nOf love and prayer\nShall dawn on every cross and care.\n\n5. The trivial round, the common task,\nWill furnish all we ought to ask\nRoom to deny ourselves a road,\nTo bring us daily nearer God.\n\n6. Only O Lord, in Thy great love,\nFit us for perfect rest above,\nAnd help us this and every day\nTo live more nearly as we pray."
