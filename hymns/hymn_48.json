  "lyrics": "Jesus, Saviour, pilot me\nOver life's tempestuous sea;\nUnknown waves before me roll\nHiding rock and treacherous shoal;\nChart and compass come from Thee:\nJesus, Saviour, pilot me.\n\nAs a mother stills her child\nThou canst hush the ocean wild;\nBoisterous waves obey Thy will\nWhen Thou say'st to them, \"Be still\"\nWondrous Sovereign of the sea,\nJesus, Saviour, pilot me.\n\nWhen at last I near the shore,\nAnd the fearful breakers roar\n'Twixt me and the peaceful rest,\nThen while leaning on Thy breast,\nMay I hear Thee say to me,\n\"Fear not, I will pilot thee.\""
