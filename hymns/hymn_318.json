    "lyrics": "1 I come to the garden alone,\nWhile the dew is still on the roses;\nAnd the voice I hear, falling on my ear,\nThe Son of God discloses.\n\nChorus:\nAnd He walks with me\nAnd he talks with me,\nAnd he tells me\nI am his own\nAnd the joy we share\nAs we tarry there\nNone other has ever known\n\n2 He speaks\nAnd the sound\nOf his voice\nIs so sweet\nThe birds\nHush their singing\nAnd melody\nThat He gave to me\nWithin my Heart\nIs ringing\n\n3 I'd stay in the\nGarden with Him\nThro' the night\nAround me be falling;\nBut He bids me go\nThru' the voice of woe,\nHis Voice to me is calling"
