    "lyrics": "1. And are we yet alive\nAnd see each other's face?\nGlory and praise to Jesus give\nFor His redeeming grace!\n\n2. Preserved by power divine\nTo full salvation here,\nAgain in Jesus' praise we join,\nAnd in His sight appear,\n\n3. What troubles have we seen,\nWhat conflicts have we passed,\nFightings without, and fears within,\nSince we assembled last.\n\n4. But out of all the Lord\nHath brought us by His love;\nAnd still He doth His help afford,\nAnd hides our life above.\n\n5. Then let us make our boast\nOf His redeeming power,\nWhich saves us to the uttermost,\nTill we can sin no more;\n\n6. Let us take up the cross,\nTill we the crown obtain;\nAnd gladly reckon all things loss,\nSo we may Jesus gain."
