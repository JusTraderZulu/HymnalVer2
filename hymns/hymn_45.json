  "lyrics": "O Lord, turn not Thy face from me,\nWho lie in woeful state,\nLamenting all my sinful life\nBefore Thy mercy-gate.\n\nA gate which opens wide to those\nThat do lament their sin;\nShut not that gate against me, Lord,\nBut let me enter in.\n\nAnd call me not to strict account\nHow I have sojourn'd here;\nFor then my guilty conscience knows\nHow vile I shall appear.\n\nMercy, Good Lord, mercy I ask;\nThis is my humble prayer;\nFor mercy, Lord, is all my suit,\nO let Thy mercy spare."
