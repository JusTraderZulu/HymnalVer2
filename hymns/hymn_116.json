    "lyrics": "The Church's one foundation\nIs Jesus Christ her Lord;\nShe is His new creation\nBy water and the word:\nFrom Heaven He came and sought her\nTo be His Holy Bride;\nWith His own blood He bought her\nAnd for her life He died.\n\nElect from every nation,\nYet one o'er all the Earth,\nHer charter of salvation,\nOne Lord, one faith, one birth;\nOne Holy name she blesses,\nPartakes one Holy food,\nAnd to one hope she presses,\nWith every grace endued.\n\nThough with a scornful wonder\nMen see her sore opprest,\nBy schisms rent asunder,\nBy heresies distressed.\nYet Saints their watch are keeping\nTheir cry goes up, 'How long?'\nAnd soon the night of weeping\nShall be the morn of song.\n\n'Mid toil and tribulation\nAnd tumult of her war,\nShe waits the consummation\nOf peace forevermore;\nTill, with the vision glorious,\nHer longing eyes are blest,\nAnd the great church victorious\nShall be the church at rest.\n\nYet she on Earth hath union\nWith God the Three in One,\nAnd mystic sweet communion\nWith those whose rest is won:\nO happy ones and Holy!\nLord, give us grace that we,\nLike them, the meek and lowly,\nOn high may dwell with Thee."
