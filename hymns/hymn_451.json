  "lyrics": "Lord, speak to me that I may speak\nIn living echoes of Thy tone;\nAs Thou hast sought, so let me seek\nThy erring children lost and lone.\n\nO lead me, Lord, that I may lead\nThe wandering and the wavering feet;\nO feed me, Lord, that I may feed\nThy hungering ones with manna sweet.\n\nO strengthen me, that while I stand\nFirm on the Rock, and strong in Thee,\nI may stretch out a loving hand\nTo wrestlers with the troubled sea.\n\nO teach me, Lord, that I may teach\nThe precious things Thou dost impart;\nAnd wing my words, that they may reach\nThe hidden depths of many a heart.\n\nO fill me with Thy fullness, Lord,\nUntil my very heart o'erflow\nIn kindling thought and glowing word,\nThy love to tell, Thy praise to show."
