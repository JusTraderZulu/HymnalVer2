  "lyrics": "1. Father, let me dedicate,\nAll this year to Thee,\nIn whatever worldly state\nThou wilt have me be.\nNot from sorrow, pain, or care,\nFreedom dare I claim;\nThis alone shall be my prayer:\nGlorify Thy name.\n\n2. Can a child presume to choose\nWhere or how to live?\nCan a Father's love refuse\nAll the best to give?\nMore Thou givest ev'ry day\nThan the best can claim\nNor withholdest aught that may\nGlorify Thy name.\n\n3. If in mercy Thou wilt spare\nJoys that yet are mine;\nIf on life, serene and fair,\nBrighter rays may shine.\nLet my glad heart while it sings,\nThee in all proclaim\nAnd, whateâ€™er the future brings,\nGlorify Thy name.\n\n4. If Thou callest to the cross,\nAnd its shadow come,\nTurning all my gain to loss,\nShrouding heart and home.\nLet me think how Thy dear Son\nTo His glory came\nAnd in deepest woe pray on:\n'Glorify Thy name.'"
