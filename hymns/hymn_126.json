    "lyrics": "Jesu, my Lord, my God, my All,\nHear me, blest Saviour, when I call;\nHear me, and from Thy dwelling-place\nPour down the riches of Thy grace.\n\nCHORUS:\nJesu, my Lord, I Thee adore,\nOh, make me love Thee more and more.\n\nJesu, too late I Thee have sought,\nHow can I love Thee as I ought?\nAnd how extol Thy matchless fame,\nThe glorious beauty of Thy name?\n\nJesu, what didst Thou find in me,\nThat Thou hast dealt so lovingly?\nHow great the joy that Thou hast brought,\nSo far exceeding hope or thought.\n\nJesu, of Thee shall be my song,\nTo Thee my heart and soul belong;\nAll that I have or am is Thine,\nAnd Thou, blest Saviour, Thou art mine."
