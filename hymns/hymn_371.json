Israelâ€™s strength and consolation,\nHope of all the Earth Thou art,\nDear desire of every nation,\nJoy of every longing heart.\n\n3. Born Thy people to deliver,\nBorn a child and yet a King,\nBorn to reign in us for ever,\nNow Thy gracious kingdom bring.\n\n4. By Thy own Eternal Spirit.\nRule in all our hearts alone,\nBy Thy all sufficient merit,\nRaise us to Thy glorious throne."
