    "lyrics": "We are but little children weak,\nNor born in any high estate,\nWhat can we do for Jesus' sake,\nWho is so high and good and great?\n\nWe know the Holy innocents\nLaid down for Him their infant life;\nAnd martyrs brave and patient Saints\nHave stood for Him in fire and strife.\n\nWe wear the cross they wore of old,\nOur lips have learned like vows to make;\nWe need not die we cannot fight;\nWhat may we do for Jesus' sake?\n\nOh; day by day, each Christian child\nHas much to do, without, within;\nA death to die for Jesus' sake,\nA weary war to wage with sin.\n\nWhen deep within our swelling hearts\nThe thoughts of pride and anger rise,\nWhen bitter words are on our tongues,\nAnd tears of passion in our eyes;\n\nThen we may stay the angry blow,\nThen we may check the hasty word,\nGive gentle answers back again,\nAnd fight a battle for our Lord.\n\nWith smiles of peace, and looks of love,\nLight in our dwellings we may make,\nBid kind good humour brighten there\nAnd still do all for Jesus' sake.\n\nThere's not a child so small and weak\nBut has his little cross to take,\nHis little work of love and praise,\nThat he may do for Jesus' sake."
