  "lyrics": "Thee, we adore, Eternal name,\nAnd humbly own to Thee\nHow feeble is our mortal frame,\nWhat dying worms are we.\n\nThe year rolls round, and steals away,\nThe breath that first it gave;\nWhate'er we do, where'er we stray,\nWe're traveling to the grave.\n\nEternal joy or endless woe,\nAttends on every breath,\nAnd yet how unconcerned we go,\nUpon the brink of death.\n\nAwake, O Lord, our drowsy sense,\nTo walk this dangerous road,\nAnd if our souls are hurried hence,\nMay they be found with God."
