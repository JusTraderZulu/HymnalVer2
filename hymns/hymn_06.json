    "lyrics": "My Father is omnipotent\nAnd that you can't deny\nA God of might and miracles\n'Tis written in the sky.\n\nCHORUS:\nIt took a miracle\nTo put the stars in place\nIt took a miracle\nTo hang the world in space\nBut when He saved my soul,\nCleansed and made me whole\nIt took a miracle\nOf love and grace.\n\nThough here His glory\nHas been shown\nWe still can't fully see\nThe wonders of His might,\nHis throne,\n'Twill take eternity.\n\nThe Bible tells us of His power\nAnd wisdom all way through\nAnd every little bird and flower\nAre testimonies too."
