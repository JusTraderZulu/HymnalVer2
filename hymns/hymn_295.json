Sing the wondrous love of Jesus,\nSing His mercy and His grace;\nIn the mansions,\nBright and blessed,\nHe'll prepare for us a place.\n\nCHORUS:\nWhen we all get to Heaven,\nWhat a day of rejoicing that will be!\nWhen we all see Jesus\nWe'll sing and shout the victory.\n\n2. While we walk the pilgrim pathway,\nClouds will overspread the sky;\nBut when trav'ling days are over,\nNot a shadow, not a sigh.\n\n3. Let us then be true and faithful\nTrusting, serving every day;\nJust one glimpse of Him in glory\nWill the toils of life repay.\n\n4. Onward to the prize before us!\nSoon His beauty we'll behold;\nSoon the pearly gates will open,\nWe shall tread the streets of gold."
