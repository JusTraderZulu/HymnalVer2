    "lyrics": "Fierce raged the tempest o'er the deep,\nWatch did thine anxious servant keep,\nBut thou wast wrapped in guileless sleep, Calm and still.\n\nSave, Lord; we perish, was their cry.\nOh, save us in our agony,\nThy word above the storm rose high\nPeace, be still.\n\nThe wild winds hushed, the angry deep Sank like a little child to sleep,\nThe sullen billows ceased to leap, At Thy will.\n\nSo, when our life is clouded o'er,\nAnd storm-winds drift us from the shore,\nSay, lest we sink to rise no more:\nPeace, be still."
