    "lyrics": "1. O Jesus, I have promised\nTo serve Thee to the end;\nBe Thou for ever near me,\nMy Master and my Friend:\nI shall not fear the battle\nIf Thou art by my side,\nNor wander from the pathway\nIf Thou wilt be my Guide.\n\n2. O let me feel Thee near me;\nThe world is ever near;\nI see the sights that dazzle,\nThe tempting sounds I hear;\nMy foes are ever near me,\nAround me and within;\nBut, Jesus, draw Thou nearer,\nAnd shield my soul from sin.\n\n3. O let me hear Thee speaking\nIn accents clear and still,\nAbove the storms of passion,\nThe murmurs of self‑will;\nO speak to reassure me,\nTo hasten or control;\nO speak, and make me listen,\nThou Guardian of my soul.\n\n4. O Jesus, Thou hast promised\nTo all who follow Thee,\nThat where Thou art in glory\nThere shall Thy servant be;\nAnd, Jesus, I have promised\nTo serve Thee to the end:\nO give me grace to follow,\nMy Master and my Friend.\n\n5. O let me see Thy foot‑marks\nAnd in them plant mine own;\nMy hope to follow duly\nIs in Thy strength alone;\nO guide me, call me, draw me,\nUphold me to the end;\nAnd then in Heaven receive me,\nMy Saviour and my Friend."
