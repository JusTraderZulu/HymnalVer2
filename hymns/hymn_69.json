  "lyrics": "The great Physician now is near,\nThe sympathizing Jesus;\nHe speaks the drooping heart to cheer,\nO hear the voice of Jesus!\n\nCHORUS:\nSweetest note in seraph song,\nSweetest name on mortal tongue:\nSweetest carol ever sung,\nJesus, blessed Jesus.\n\nYour many sins are all forgiven,\nOh hear the voice of Jesus!\nGo on your way in peace to Heaven,\nAnd wear a crown with Jesus.\n\nAll glory to the risen Lamb!\nI now believe in Jesus\nI love the blessed Saviour's name,\nI love the name of Jesus.\n\nHis name dispels my guilt and fear,\nNo other name but Jesus;\nOh how my soul delights to hear\nThe precious name of Jesus!\n\nCome brethren help me sing His praise,\nOh praise the name of Jesus,\nCome sisters all your voices raise,\nOh bless the name of Jesus!\n\nThe children too both great and small,\nWho love the name of Jesus;\nMay now accept the gracious call,\nTo work and live for Jesus.\n\nAnd when to the bright world above\nWe rise to be with Jesus,\nWe'll sing around the throne of love\nHis name, the name of Jesus."
