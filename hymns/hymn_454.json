  "lyrics": "Depth of mercy! Can there be\nmercy still reserved for me?\nCan my God His wrath forbear,\nme, the chief of sinners, spare?\n\nI have long withstood His grace,\nlong provoked Him to His face;\nwould not hearken to His calls,\ngrieved Him by a thousand falls.\n\nI my Master have denied;\nI afresh have crucified,\noft profaned His hallowed name,\nput Him to an open shame.\n\nThere for me the Savior stands,\nshows His wounds and spreads His hands.\nGod is love! I know, I feel;\nJesus weeps, but loves me still!\n\nNow incline me to repent,\nlet me now my sins lament,\nnow my foul revolt deplore!\nweep, believe, and sin no more."
