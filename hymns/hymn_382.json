  "lyrics": "Abide with me;\nFast falls the eventide;\nThe darkness deepens;\nLord, with me abide!\nWhen other helpers fail,\nAnd comforts flee,\nHelp of the helpless,\nO abide with me.\n\nSwift to its close ebbs\nOut life's little day;\nEarth's joys grow dim,\nIts glories pass away;\nChange and decay\nIn all around I see;\nO Thou who changest not,\nAbide with me!\n\nI need Thy presence\nEvery passing hour;\nWhat but Thy grace\nCan foil the tempter's power?\nWho like Thyself my guide\nAnd stay can be?\nThrough cloud and sunshine Lord,\nAbide with me.\n\nI fear no foe,\nWith Thee at hand to bless;\nl’ll have no weight,\nAnd tears no bitterness;\nWhere is death's sting?\nWhere, grave, Thy victory?\nl’ll triumph still,\nlf Thou abide with me.\n\nHold Thou Thy cross\nBefore my closing eyes,\nShine through the gloom,\nAnd point me to the skies;\nHeaven's morning breaks,\nAnd Earth's vain shadows flee;\nIn life, in death,\nO Lord, abide with me!"
