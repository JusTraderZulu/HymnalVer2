    "lyrics": "Out of the deep I call,\nTo Thee O Lord to Thee,\nBefore Thy throne\nOf Grace I fall,\nBe merciful to me.\n\nOut of the deep I cry\nThe woeful deep of sin,\nOf evil done\nIn days gone by,\nOf evil now within.\n\nOut of the deep of fear,\nAnd dread of coming shame,\nFrom morning watch\nTill night is near,\nI plead the precious name.\n\nLord there is mercy now,\nAs ever was with Thee,\nBefore Thy throne\nOf grace I bow,\nBe merciful to me."
