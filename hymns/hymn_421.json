    "lyrics": "DO no sinful action,\nSpeak no angry word;\nYe belong to Jesus,\nChildren of the Lord,\n\nChrist is kind and gentle,\nChrist is pure and true;\nAnd His little children\nMust be holy too.\n\nThere's a wicked spirit\nWatching round you still,\nAnd he tries to tempt you\nTo all harm and ill.\n\nBut ye must not hear him,\nThough 'tis hard for you\nTo resist the evil,\nAnd the good to do.\n\nFor ye promised truly,\nIn your infant days,\nTo renounce him wholly,\nAnd forsake his ways.\n\nYe are new-born Christians,\nYe must learn to fight\nWith the bad within you,\nAnd to do the right.\n\nChrist is your own Master,\nHe is good and true,\nAnd His little children\nMust be holy too."
