    "lyrics": "I saw a wayworn traveler\nIn tattered garments clad\nAnd struggling up the mountain,\nIt seemed that he was sad,\nHis back was laden heavy\nHis strength was almost gone;\nYet he shouted as he journeyed\n\"Deliverance will come!\"\n\nCHORUS:\n\"Then palms of victory,\nCrowns of glory\nPalms of victory I shall bear.\"\n\nThe summer sun was shining,\nThe sweat was on his brow\nHis garments worn and dusty,\nHis step seemed very slow;\nBut kept pressing onward;\nFor he was wending Home,\nStill shouting as he journeyed,\n\"Deliverance will come.\"\n\nThe songsters in the arbor,\nThat stood beside the way,\nAttracted his attention\nInviting his delay\nHis watchword being \"onward!\"\nHe stopped his ears and ran\nStill shouting as he journeyed,\n\"Deliverance will come.\"\n\nI saw him in the evening,\nThe sun was bending low,\nHe'd over topped the mountain,\nAnd reached the vale below,\nHe saw the golden city;\nHis everlasting Home,\nAnd shouted loud, \"Hosanna!\nDeliverance will come!\"\n\nWhile gazing on that city,\nJust o'er the narrow flood\nA band of Holy Angels\nCame from the throne of God,\nThey bore him on their pinions,\nSafe o'er the dashing foam,\nAnd joined him in His triumph,\n\"Deliverance had come!\"\n\nI heard the song of triumph,\nThey sang upon the shore;\nSaying, \"Jesus has redeemed us\nTo suffer never more!\"\nThen, casting his eyes backward,\nOn the race which he had run,\nHe shouted loud, \"Hosanna,\nDeliverance has come!\""
