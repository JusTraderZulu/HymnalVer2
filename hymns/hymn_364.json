    "lyrics": "Once in Royal David's city,\nStood a lowly cattle shed,\nWhere a Mother laid her baby\nIn a manger for His bed,\nMary was that Mother mild,\nJesus Christ her little child.\n\nHe came down to Earth from Heaven,\nWho is God and Lord of all,\nAnd His shelter was a stable,\nAnd His cradle was a stall,\nWith the poor and mean and lowly,\nLived on Earth our Saviour Holy.\n\nAnd through all\nHis wondrous childhood,\nHe would honour and obey,\nLove and watch the lowly Mother,\nIn whose gentle arms He lay,\nChristian children all must be,\nMild, obedient, good as He.\n\nFor He is our childhood's pattern,\nDay by day like us He grew,\nHe was little, weak and helpless,\nTears and smiles like us He knew,\nAnd He feeleth for our sadness,\nAnd He shareth in our gladness.\n\nAnd our eyes\nAt last shall see Him,\nThrough His own redeeming love,\nFor that Child so dear and gentle\nIs our Lord in Heaven above,\nAnd He leads His children on,\nTo the place where He is gone.\n\nNot in that poor lowly stable,\nWith the oxen standing by,\nWe shall see Him but in Heaven,\nSet at God's right hand on high\nWhen like stars\nHis children crowned\nAll in white shall wait around."
