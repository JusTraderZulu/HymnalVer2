    "lyrics": "1\nWhile shepherds kept their watching\nO’er silent flocks by night,\nBehold, throughout the heavens\nThere shone a holy light.\n\nChorus:\nGo, tell it on the mountain,\nOver the hills and everywhere;\nGo, tell it on the mountain,\nThat Jesus Christ is born.\n\n2\nThe shepherds feared and trembled,\nWhen lo! above the earth\nRang out the angel chorus\nThat hailed the Savior’s birth.\n\n3\nDown in a lowly manger\nThe humble Christ was born,\nAnd God sent us salvation\nThat blessed Christmas morn."
