    "lyrics": "Hark! hark, my soul! Angelic songs are swelling\nO'er Earth's green fields, and ocean's wave-beat shore:\nHow sweet the truth those blessed strains are telling\nOf that new life when sin shall be no more.\n\nCHORUS:\nAngels of Jesus, Angels of light,\nSinging to welcome the pilgrims of the night!\n\nOnward we go, for still we hear them singing,\n\"Come, weary soul, for Jesus bids you come;\"\nAnd through the dark, its echoes sweetly ringing,\nThe music of the Gospel leads us home.\n\nFar, far away, like bells at evening pealing,\nThe voice of Jesus sounds o'er land and sea,\nAnd laden souls, by thousands meekly stealing,\nKind Shepherd, turn their weary steps to Thee.\n\nRest comes at length: though life be long and dreary,\nThe day must dawn, and darksome night be past;\nFaith's journey ends in welcome to the weary,\nAnd Heaven, the heart's true home, will come at last.\n\nAngels! sing on, your faithful watches keeping,\nSing us sweet fragments of the songs above;\nTill morning's joy shall end the night of weeping,\nAnd life's long shadows break in cloudless love."
