    "lyrics": "We are often tossed and driven\nOn the restless sea of time,\nSombre skies and howling tempests\nOft succeed a bright sunshine,\nIn that land of perfect day,\nWhen the mists have rolled away,\nWe will understand it better,\nBy and by.\n\nCHORUS:\nBy and by when the morning comes,\nWhen the Saints of God\nAre gathered home,\nWe'll tell the story\nHow we've overcome,\nFor we'll understand it better\nBy and by.\n\nWe are often destitute\nOf the things that life demands,\nWant of food and want of shelter,\nThirsty hills and barren lands,\nWe are trusting in the Lord\nAnd according to His word,\nFor we will understand it better,\nBy and by.\n\nTrials dark on every hand\nAnd we cannot understand,\nAll the ways that God would lead us\nTo that blessed promised land,\nBut He guides us with His eye\nAnd we'll follow till we die,\nFor we'll understand it better\nBy and by.\n\nTemptations hidden snares\nOften take us unawares\nAnd our hearts are made to bleed for\nMany a thoughtless word or deed,\nAnd we wonder why the test\nWhen we try to do our best,\nBut we'll understand it better\nBy and by."
