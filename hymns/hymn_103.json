    "lyrics": "Low in the grave He lay\nJesus, my Saviour!\nWaiting the coming day\nJesus my Lord!\n\nCHORUS:\nUp from the grave He arose,\nWith a mighty triumph o'er His foes;\nHe arose a Victor from the dark domain,\nAnd He lives forever with His Saints to reign:\nHe arose! He arose!\nHallelujah! Christ arose!\n\nVainly they watch His bed\nJesus, my Saviour!\nVainly they seal the dead\nJesus my Lord!\n\nDeath cannot keep his prey\nJesus, my Saviour!\nHe tore the bars away\nJesus my Lord!"
