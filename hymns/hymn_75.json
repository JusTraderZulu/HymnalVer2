    "lyrics": "As I journey through the land,\nSinging as I go,\nPointing souls to Calvary,\nTo the crimson flow,\nMany arrows pierce my soul\nFrom without, within;\nBut my Lord leads me on,\nThru Him I must win.\n\nCHORUS:\nO I want to see Him\nLook upon His face,\nThere to sing forever\nOf His saving grace;\nOn the streets of Glory\nLet me lift my voice;\nCares all past,\nHome at last, ever to rejoice.\n\nWhen in service for my Lord\nDark may be the night,\nBut I'll cling more close to Him,\nHe will give me light;\nSatan's snares may vex my soul,\nTurn my thoughts aside;\nBut my Lord goes ahead,\nLeads whate'er betide.\n\nWhen in valleys low\nI look t'ward the mountain height,\nAnd behold my Saviour there,\nLeading in the fight\nWith a tender hand outstretched\nT'ward the valley low,\nGuiding me, I can see,\nAs I onward go.\n\nWhen before me billows rise\nFrom the mighty deep,\nThen my Lord directs my bark,\nHe doth safely keep,\nAnd He leads me gently on\nThru this world below;\nHe's a real friend to me,\nO I love Him so."
