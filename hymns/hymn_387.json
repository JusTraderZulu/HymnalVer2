    "lyrics": "Sleep, on beloved\nSleep and take thy rest,\nLay down Thy head\nUpon thy Saviour's breast\nWe love thee well,\nBut Jesus loves thee best,\nGoodnight, goodnight, goodnight.\n\nCalm is Thy slumber,\nAs an infant's sleep,\nBut Thou shalt wake\nNo more to toil and weep,\nThine is a perfect rest,\nSecure and deep,\nGoodnight, goodnight, goodnight.\n\nUntil the shadows\nFrom this Earth are cast,\nUntil He gathers in\nHis sheaves at last,\nUntil the twilight\nGloom is over past,\nGoodnight, goodnight, goodnight.\n\nUntil the Easter glory\nLights the skies,\nUntil the dead in Jesus shall arise\nAnd He shall come,\nBut not in lowly guise,\nGoodnight, goodnight, goodnight.\n\nUntil made beautiful by love\nDivine,\nThou in the likeness\nOf Thy Lord shalt shine,\nAnd He shall bring\nThat golden crown of thine,\nGoodnight, goodnight, goodnight.\n\nOnly goodnight, beloved not farewell,\nA little while.\nAnd all His Saints shall dwell,\nIn hallowed union, indivisible\nGoodnight, goodnight, goodnight.\n\nUntil we meet again\nBefore His throne,\nClothed in the spotless robe,\nHe gives His own,\nUntil we know\nEven as we are known,\nGoodnight, goodnight, goodnight."
