    "lyrics": "Come, O Thou traveller unknown,\nWhom still I hold but cannot see!\nMy company before is gone,\nAnd I am left alone with Thee;\nWith Thee all night I mean to stay,\nAnd wrestle till the break of day.\n\nI need not tell Thee who I am,\nMy misery and sin declare;\nThyself hast called me by my name;\nLook on Thy hands\nAnd read it there:\nBut who I ask Thee who art Thou?\nTell me Thy name and tell me now.\n\nIn vain Thou strugglest to get free;\nI never will unloose my hold!\nArt Thou the man\nThat died for me?\nThe secret of Thy love unfold;\nWrestling, I will not let Thee go,\nTill I Thy name, Thy nature know.\n\nYield to me now for I am weak,\nBut confident in self despair;\nSpeak to my heart in blessings speak,\nBe conquered by my instant prayer;\nSpeak, or Thou never\nHence shalt move,\nAnd tell me if Thy Name is Love.\n\n'Tis love! 'tis love!\nThou diedst for me\nI hear Thy whisper in my heart;\nThe morning breaks,\nThe shadows flee,\nPure, universal love Thou art;\nTo me, to all, Thy mercies move;\nThy nature and Thy name is love."
