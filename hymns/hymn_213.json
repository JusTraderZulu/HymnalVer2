There is a peace in my heart,\nThat the world never gave,\nA peace it cannot take away;\nThough the trials of life\nMay surround like a cloud,\nIâ€™ve a peace\nThat has come there to stay!\n\nChorus:\nConstantly abiding,\nJesus is mine;\nConstant abiding,\nRapture divine;\nHe never leaves me lonely,\nWhispers so kind:\n'I will never leave thee,'\nJesus is mine.\n\n2. All the world seemed to sing\nOf a Saviour and King,\nWhen peace sweetly came\nTo my heart;\nTroubles all fled away\nAnd my night turned to day,\nBlessed Jesus,\nHow glorious Thou art!\n\n3. This treasure I have\nIn a temple of clay,\nWhile here on His footstool I roam;\nBut He is coming to take me\nSome glorious day,\nOver there to my\nHeavenly home!"
