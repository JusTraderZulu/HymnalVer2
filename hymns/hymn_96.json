    "lyrics": "I was a wandering sheep,\nI did not love the fold;\nI did not love my Shepherd's voice,\nI would not be controlled.\n\nI was a wayward child,\nI did not love my home;\nI did not love my Father's voice,\nI loved afar to roam.\n\nThe Shepherd sought His sheep,\nThe Father sought His child;\nThey followed me o'er vale and hill,\nO'er deserts waste and wild.\n\nThey found me nigh to death,\nFamished and faint and lone;\nThey bound me with the bands of love,\nThey saved the wandering one.\n\nJesus my Shepherd is;\n'Twas He that loved my soul,\n'Twas He that washed me in His blood,\n'Twas He that made me whole.\n\n'Twas He that sought the lost,\nThat found the wandering sheep,\n'Twas He that brought me to the fold,\n'Tis He that still doth keep.\n\nI was a wandering sheep,\nI would not be controlled;\nBut now I love my Shepherd's voice,\nI love, I love the fold.\n\nI was a wayward child,\nI once preferred to roam;\nBut now I love my Father's voice,\nI love, I love His home."
