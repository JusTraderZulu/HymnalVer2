This I know,\nFor the Bible tells me so;\nLittle ones to Him belong;\nThey are weak, but He is strong.\n\nChorus:\nYes, Jesus loves me!\nYes, Jesus loves me!\nYes, Jesus loves me!\nThe Bible tells me so.\n\n2. Jesus loves me! He who died\nHeavenâ€™s gate to open wide;\nHe will wash away my sin,\nLet His little child come in.\n\n3. Jesus, take this heart of mine,\nMake it pure and wholly Thine;\nOn the cross You died for me,\nI will love and live for Thee."
