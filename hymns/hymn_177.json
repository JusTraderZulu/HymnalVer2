    "lyrics": "1\nI am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice,\nAnd it told Thy love to me;\nBut I long to rise in the arms of faith\nAnd be closer drawn to Thee.\n\nChorus:\nDraw me nearer, nearer blessed Lord,\nTo the cross where Thou hast died;\nDraw me nearer, nearer, nearer blessed Lord,\nTo Thy precious, bleeding side.\n\n2\nConsecrate me now to Thy service, Lord,\nBy the powâ€™r of grace divine;\nLet my soul look up with a steadfast hope,\nAnd my will be lost in Thine.\n\n3\nOh, the pure delight of a single hour\nThat before Thy throne I spend,\nWhen I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God\nI commune as friend with friend!\n\n4\nThere are depths of love that I cannot know\nTill I cross the narrow sea;\nThere are heights of joy that I may not reach\nTill I rest in peace with Thee."
