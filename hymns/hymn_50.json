    "lyrics": "I love to tell the story\nOf unseen things above,\nOf Jesus and His glory\nOf Jesus and His love!\nI love to tell the Story\nBecause I know it's true;\nIt satisfies my longings\nAs nothing else can do.\n\nCHORUS:\nI love to tell the Story\n'Twill be my theme in glory\nTo tell the old, old Story\nOf Jesus and His love.\n\nI love to tell the Story!\nMore wonderful it seems\nThan all the golden fancies\nOf all our golden dreams,\nI love to tell the Glory!\nIt did so much for me,\nAnd that is just the reason,\nI tell it now to Thee.\n\nI love to tell the Story!\n'Tis pleasant to repeat\nWhat seems, each time l tell it,\nMore wonderfully sweet\nI love to tell the Story;\nFor some have never heard\nThe message of salvation\nFrom God's own Holy Word.\n\nI love to tell the Story!\nFor those who know it best\nSeem hungering and thirsting\nTo hear it, like the rest.\nAnd when in scenes of glory\nI sing the new, new song\n'Twill be the old, old Story\nThat I have loved so long."
