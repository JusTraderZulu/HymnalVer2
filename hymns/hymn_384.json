Now the labourer's task is over;\nNow the battle day is past;\nNow upon the farther shore\nLands the voyager at last,\nFather, in Thy gracious keeping\nLeave we now Thy servant sleeping.\n\n2. There the tears of Earth are dried;\nThere its hidden things are clear;\nThere the work of life is tried\nBy a juster Judge than here,\nFather, in Thy gracious keeping\nLeave we now Thy servant sleeping.\n\n3. There the sinful soul, that turn\nTo the Cross their dying eyes\nAll the love of Christ shall learn\nAt His Feet in Paradise,\nFather, in Thy gracious keeping\nLeave we now Thy servant sleeping.\n\n4. There no more the powers of hell\nCan prevail to mar their peace;\nChrist the Lord shall guard them well,\nHe who died for their release,\nFather, in Thy gracious keeping\nLeave we now Thy servant sleeping.\n\n5. Earth to Earth, and dust to dust,\nCalmly now the words we say,\nLeaving him to sleep in trust\nTill the Resurrection-day,\nFather, in Thy gracious keeping\nLeave we now Thy servant sleeping."
