    "lyrics": "God will take care of you.\nBe not afraid.\nHe is your safeguard\nThrough sunshine and shade\nTenderly watching\nAnd keeping His own,\nHe will not leave you\nTo wander alone.\n\nCHORUS:\nGod will take care of you\nStill to the end\nOh, what a Father,\nRedeemer, and Friend,\nJesus will answer\nWhenever you call,\nHe will take care of you\nTrust Him for all.\n\nGod will take care of you\nThrough all the day,\nShielding your footsteps,\nDirecting your way,\nHe is your shepherd,\nProtector, and guide,\nLeading His children\nWhere still waters glide.\n\nGod will take care of you.\nLong as you live.\nGranting you blessings\nNo other can give,\nHe will take care of you.\nWhen time is past,\nSafe to His kingdom\nWill bring you at last."
