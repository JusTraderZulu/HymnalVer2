    "lyrics": "Jerusalem the golden,\nWith milk and honey blest,\nBeneath Thy contemplation\nSink heart and voice opprest,\nI know not, O I know not,\nWhat holy joys are there,\nWhat radiancy of glory,\nWhat bliss beyond compare!\n\nThey stand, those halls of Zion,\nAll jubilant with song,\nAnd bright with many an Angel\nAnd all the martyr-throng;\nThere is the throne of David;\nAnd there, from toil released,\nThe shout of them that triumph\nThe song of them that feast.\n\nAnd they who with their leader,\nHave conquered in the fight\nFor ever and for ever,\nAre clad in robes of white;\nO land that see'st no sorrow\nO state that fear'st no strife.\nO royal land of flowers!\nO realm and home of life!\n\nO sweet and blessed country\nThe home of God's elect,\nO sweet and blessed country\nThat eager hearts expect\nJesus, in mercy bring us\nTo that dear land of rest,\nWho art, with God the Father,\nAnd Spirit, ever blest!"
