    "lyrics": "Loving Shepherd of Thy sheep,\nKeep Thy lamb in safety keep,\nNothing can Thy power withstand,\nNone can pluck me from Thy hand.\n\nLoving Saviour Thou didst give,\nThine own life that we might live,\nAnd the hands outstretch'd to bless,\nBear the cruel nails impress.\n\nI would praise Thee every day,\nGladly all Thy will obey,\nLike Thy blessed ones above,\nHappy in Thy precious love.\n\nLoving shepherd ever near,\nTeach Thy lamb Thy voice to hear,\nSuffer not my steps to stray,\nFrom the straight and narrow way.\n\nWhere Thou leadest I would go,\nWalking in Thy steps below,\nTill before my Father's throne,\nI shall know as I am known."
