    "lyrics": "Souls of men! why will ye scatter\nLike a crowd of frighten'd sheep?\nFoolish hearts! why will ye wander\nFrom a love so true and deep?\n\nWas there ever kindest shepherd\nHalf so gentle, half so sweet,\nAs the Saviour who would have us\nCome and gather round His feet?\n\nThere's a wideness in God's mercy,\nLike the wideness of the sea;\nThere's a kindness in His justice,\nWhich is more than liberty.\n\nThere is no place\nWhere Earth's sorrows\nAre more felt than up in Heaven;\nThere is no place\nWhere Earth's failings\nHave such kindly judgment given.\n\nThere is plentiful redemption\nIn the blood that has been shed;\nThere is joy for all the members\nIn the sorrows of the Head.\n\nFor the love of God is broader\nThan the measures of man's minds:\nAnd the Heart of the Eternal\nIs most wonderfully kind.\n\nPining souls! come nearer Jesus,\nAnd oh! come not doubting thus,\nBut with faith\nThat trusts more bravely\nHis huge tenderness for us.\n\nIf our love were but more simple,\nWe should take Him at His word;\nAnd our lives would be\nAll sunshine\nIn the sweetness of our Lord."
