    "lyrics": "In loving kindness Jesus came\nMy soul in mercy to reclaim,\nAnd from the depths of sin\nAnd shame thru grace he lifted me.\n\nCHORUS:\nFrom sinking sand\nHe lifted me,\nWith tender hand\nHe lifted me;\nFrom shades of night\nTo plains of light\nO praise His name, He lifted me.\n\nHe called me long before I heard,\nBefore my sinful heart was stirred,\nBut when I took Him at His word,\nForgiv'n He lifted me.\n\nHis brow was pierced with many a thorn,\nHis hands by cruel nails were torn,\nWhen from my guilt and grief, forlorn,\nIn love He lifted me.\n\nNow on a higher plane l dwell,\nAnd with my soul I know 'tis well;\nYet how or why, I cannot tell,\nHe should have lifted me."
