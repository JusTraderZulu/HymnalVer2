I am trusting Thee for pardon;\n\nAt Thy feet I bow;\nFor Thy grace and tender mercy,\nTrusting now.\n\n3. I am trusting Thee for cleansing\n\nIn the crimson flood;\nTrusting Thee to make me holy\nBy Thy blood.\n\n4. I am trusting Thee to guide me;\n\nThou alone shalt lead;\nEvery day and hour supplying\nAll my need.\n\n5. I am trusting Thee for power,\n\nThine can never fail;\nWords which Thou Thyself shalt\ngive me\nMust prevail.\n\n6. I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus;\n\nNever let me fall;\nI am trusting Thee forever,\nAnd for all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell Jesus, You know, if You're looking\nbelow, it's worse now than then\nCheating an stealing, violence and crime\nSo for my sake, teach me how to take one\nday at a time\n\nOne day at a time, sweet Jesus\nThat's all I'm asking from You\nJust give me the strength to do everyday\nWhat I have to do\nYesterday's gone, sweet Jesus\nAnd tomorrow may never be mine\nLord, help me today, show me the way\nOne day at a time\n\nOne day at a time, sweet Jesus\n\nI'm only human, I'm just a woman\n(man/woman)\nHelp me believe, in what I could be, and all\nthat I am\nShow me the stairway, I have to climb\nLord, for my sake teach me how to take one\nday at a time\n\nOne day at a time, sweet Jesus\nThat's all I'm asking from You\nJust give me the strength to do everyday\nWhat I have to do\n\nYesterday's gone, sweet Jesus\nAnd tomorrow may never be mine\nLord, help me today, show me the way\nOne day at a time\n\nDo you remember, when You walked among\nmen?"
