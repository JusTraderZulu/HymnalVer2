    "lyrics": "I will sing the wondrous story\nOf the Christ who died for me\nHow He left His home in glory\nFor the cross of Calvary.\n\nCHORUS:\nYes, I'll sing the wondrous story\nOf the Christ who died for me,\nSing it with the Saints in glory,\nGathered by the crystal sea.\n\nI was lost but Jesus found me\nFound the sheep that went astray,\nThrew His loving arms around me,\nDrew me back into the way.\n\nI was bruised but Jesus healed me\nFaint was I from many a fall;\nSight was gone\nAnd fears possessed me,\nBut He freed me from them all.\n\nSoon He'll come the Lord of Glory,\nCome the church His bride to claim;\nAnd complete the wondrous story,\nCome, Lord Jesus, come again.\n\nHe will keep me till the river\nRolls its waters at my feet;\nThen He'll bear me safely over,\nWhere the loved ones I shall meet."
