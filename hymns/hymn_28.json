  "lyrics": "Jesus, my all, to Heaven is gone,\nHe whom I fixed my hopes upon,\nHis track I see, and I'll pursue,\nThe narrow way, till Him I view.\n\nThe way the Holy prophets went,\nThe road that leads\nFrom banishment,\nThe King's highway of Holiness,\nI'll go, for all\nHis paths are peace.\n\nThis is the way\nI long have sought,\nAnd mourned because\nI found it not,\nMy grief and burden\nLong have been,\nBecause I could not cease\nFrom sin.\n\nThe more I strove against\nIts power,\nI sinned and stumbled\nBut the more,\nTill late I heard my Savior say,\n\"Come hither, soul, I am the way.\"\n\nLo, glad I come;\nAnd Thou, blest Lamb,\nShalt take me to Thee as I am,\nNothing but sin have I to give,\nNothing but love shall I receive.\n\nNow will I tell to sinners round\nWhat a dear Savior I have found,\nI'll point to Thy redeeming blood,\nAnd say, \"Behold the way to God.\""
