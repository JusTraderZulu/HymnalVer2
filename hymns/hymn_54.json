    "lyrics": "Lift me up above the shadows,\nPlant my feet on higher ground,\nLift me up above the clouds, Lord,\nWhere the pure sunshine is found;\nLift me up above my weakness,\nLift me up into Thy strength,\nLift me up above the shadows,\nTill I stand with Thee at length.\n\nCHORUS:\nLift me up above the shadows,\nLift me up and let me stand\nOn the mountain tops of glory,\nLet me dwell in Beulah land.\n\nLift me up above the shadows,\nFor the storms are raging high,\nLift me up, my blessed Savior,\nLet me to Thy bosom fly;\nThere no evil thing can touch me,\nOver on the shining side,\nLift me up above the shadows,\nLet me evermore abide.\n\nLift me up above the shadows,\nOut of sorrow into joy,\nLift me up above my grief, Lord,\nGive me gold for my alloy;\nThen when death must claim my spirit,\nAnd the storms of life are past,\nLift me up above the shadows,\nTill in Heav'n I stand at last.\n\nLift us up above the shadows,\nWhen to Earth you come again,\nLet us be in the assembly,\nAs Thy bride to ever reign;\nIn Thy kingdom full of glory,\nWith our friends we'll ever be,\nLift us up above the shadows,\nThere to dwell eternally."
