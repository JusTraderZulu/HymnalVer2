    "lyrics": "1. Christ will gather in His own,\nTo the place where He is gone,\nWhere their heart and treasure lie,\nWhere our life is hid on high.\n\n2. Day by day the voice saith come,\nEnter Thine eternal home,\nAsking not if we can spare,\nThis dear soul it summons there.\n\n3. Had He asked us well we know\nWe should cry O spare this blow,\nYes, with streaming tears should pray,\nLord, Well love Him let Him stay.\n\n4. But the Lord doth nought amiss,\nAnd since He hath ordered this\nWe have nought to do but still,\nRest in silence on His will.\n\n5. Many a heart no longer here\nAh, was all too only dear\nYet, O love 'tis Thou dost call,\nThou wilt be our all in all."
