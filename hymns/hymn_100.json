    "lyrics": "We have heard the joyful sound,\nJesus saves! Jesus saves!\nTell the message all around,\nJesus saves! Jesus saves!\nBear the news to every land,\nClimb the steeps and cross the waves;\nOnward! 'tis our Lord's command,\nJesus saves! Jesus saves!\n\nWaft it on the rolling tide:\nJesus saves! Jesus saves!\nTell to sinners far and wide:\nJesus saves! Jesus saves!\nSing, ye islands of the sea,\nEcho back, ye ocean caves;\nEarth shall keep her jubilee;\nJesus saves! Jesus saves!\n\nSing above the toil and strife,\nJesus saves! Jesus saves!\nBy His death and endless life\nJesus saves! Jesus saves!\nSing it softly through the gloom,\nWhen the heart for mercy craves;\nSing in triumph o'er the tomb,\nJesus saves! Jesus saves!\n\nGive the winds a mighty voice;\nJesus saves! Jesus saves!\nLet the nations now rejoice,\nJesus saves! Jesus saves!\nShout salvation full and free,\nTo every strand that ocean laves,\nThis our song of victory,\nJesus saves! Jesus saves!"
