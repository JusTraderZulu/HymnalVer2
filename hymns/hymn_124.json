    "lyrics": "Time's clock is striking\nThe hour Jesus will soon descend,\nClothed in the garments of\nPower the reign of sin to end\nThen will this anthem be ringing,\nLike to a mighty flood;\nThen round the throne we'll be singing\nGlory and praise to God.\n\nCHORUS:\nGlory, glory to God,\nThus will the ransomed sing,\nGlory, glory to God,\nThe everlasting King\nPraise Him, Alleluia\nTo that eternal sphere we are waiting\nFor our translating’ the time is near.\n\nIn those bright mansions\nSupernal death cannot enter there,\nAges on ages eternal!\nHis likeness we shall bear,\nThere will the once broken hearted\nRest in the Spirit know\nSorrow forever departed\nGladness shall overflow.\n\nSighing forever is ended\nFoes shall oppress no more,\nVoices in worship are blended;\nTo Him whom all adore;\nBathed in the light soft and tender,\nSealed for eternity,\nPraise to the Lamb, we will render;\nWorthy of praise is He.\n\nBeautiful, wonderful story\nJesus Himself the light,\nThere in the kingdom of glory\nNever shall fall the night;\nNow I am singing of Heaven\nWhile here I wage the strife,\nThen will the victors be given,\nCrowns of eternal life."
