    "lyrics": "1\nWhen Jacob met the Lord\nUpon that lonely night,\nAnd wrestled there alone\nUntil the morning light;\nHe won a princely title\nTo gird him for the right,\nI want that kind of blessing.\n\nChorus:\nI want, I want that kind of blessing,\nThat saves and keeps, and satisfies the soul;\nI want, I want that full salvation\nTill billows of heaven o’er me roll.\n\n2\nWhen Israel at last came\nInto Canaan’s land,\nThe Lord his riches gave\nSo full on ev’ry hand;\nThey drove their foes before them\nAnd dwelt a happy band,\nI want that kind of blessing.\n\n3\nThis is the day of grace,\nThe Comforter is here,\nWe are a chosen race,\nOur God is drawing near;\nHe’s waiting to be gracious\nThe pray’r of faith to hear,\nAnd then He’ll send the blessing."
