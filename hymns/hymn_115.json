    "lyrics": "Come, let us all unite to sing\nGod is love! God is love!\nWhile Heaven and Earth\nTheir praises bring\nGod is love! God is love!\nLet every soul from sin awake,\nEach in his heart\nSweet music make,\nAnd sweetly sing\nFor Jesus' sake,\nGod is love! God is love!\n\nOh, tell to Earth's remotest bound\nGod is love! God is love!\nIn Christ is full redemption found\nGod is love! God is love!\nHis blood can cleanse our sins away\nHis Spirit turns our night to day\nAnd leads our souls\nWith joy to say\nGod is love! God is love!\n\nHow happy is our portion here,\nGod is love! God is love!\nHis promises our spirits cheer\nGod is love! God is love!\nHe is our sun and shield by day\nBy night He near\nOur tents will stay\nHe will be with us all the way\nGod is love! God is love!\n\nWhat though my heart\nAnd flesh shall fail,\nGod is love! God is love!\nThrough Christ I shall\nOver death prevail\nGod is love! God is love!\nEven Jordan's swell I will not fear,\nFor Jesus will be with me there.\nMy soul above the waves to bear\nGod is love! God is love!"
