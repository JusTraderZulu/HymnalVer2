    "lyrics": "Ah whither shall I go\nBurdened and sick and faint?\nTo whom should I my troubles show\nAnd pour out my complaint?\n\nMy Saviour bids me come\nAh why do I delay?\nHe calls the weary sinner home\nAnd yet from Him I stray\n\nWhat is it keeps me back\nFrom which I cannot part\nWhich will not let my Saviour take\nPossession of my heart?\n\nSome cursed thing unknown\nMust surely lurk within\nSome idol which I will not own\nSome secret bossom sin\n\nJesus the hindrance show\nWhich I have feared to see\nYet let me now consent to know\nWhat keep me out of Thee\n\nSearcher of heart in mine\nThy trying power display\nInto its darkest hour shine\nAnd take the veil away\n\nI now believe in Thee\nCompassion reigns alone\nAccording to my faith to me\nO let Lord be done."
