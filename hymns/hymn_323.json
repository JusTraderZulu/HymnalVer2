    "lyrics": "1. All things bright and beautiful,\nAll creatures great and small,\nAll things wise and wonderful,\nThe Lord God made them all.\n\n2. Each little flower that opens\nEach little bird that sings,\nHe made their glowing colours,\nHe made their tiny wings.\n\n3. The rich man in His castle,\nThe poor man at His gate,\nGod made them high or lowly,\nAnd ordered their estate.\n\n4. The purple headed mountain,\nThe river running by,\nThe sunset and the morning,\nThat brightens up the sky.\n\n5. The cold wind in the winter,\nThe pleasant summer sun,\nThe ripe fruits in the garden,\nHe made them every one.\n\n6. The tall trees in the green wood,\nThe meadows where we play,\nThe rushes by the water,\nWe gather every day.\n\n7. He gave us eyes to see them,\nAnd lips that we might tell,\nHow great is God Almighty,\nWho has made all things well."
