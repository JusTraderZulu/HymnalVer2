    "lyrics": "1\nThy way, not mine, O Lord,\nHowever dark it be;\nLead me by Thine own hand,\nChoose out the path for me.\n\n2\nSmooth let it be or rough,\nIt will be still the best;\nWinding or straight, it leads\nRight onward to Thy rest.\n\n3\nI dare not choose my lot;\nI would not, if I might;\nChoose Thou for me, my God,\nSo I shall walk aright.\n\n4\nTake Thou my cup, and it\nWith joy or sorrow fill,\nAs best to Thee may seem;\nChoose Thou my good and ill.\n\n5\nChoose Thou for me my friends,\nMy sickness or my health;\nChoose Thou my cares for me,\nMy poverty or wealth.\n\n6\nThe kingdom that I seek\nIs Thine: so let the way\nThat leads to it be Thine,\nElse I must surely stray.\n\n7\nNot mine, not mine the choice\nIn things or great or small;\nBe Thou my guide, my strength\nMy wisdom, and my all."
