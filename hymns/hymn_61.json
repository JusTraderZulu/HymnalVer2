    "lyrics": "Am I a soldier of the cross,\nA follower of the Lamb?\nAnd shall I fear to own His cause,\nOr blush to speak His name?\n\nCHORUS:\nAnd when the battle's over\nWe shall wear a crown\nYes, we shall wear a crown\nYes, we shall wear a crown,\nAnd when the battleâ€™s over\nWe shall wear a crown\nIn the New Jerusalem\nWear a crown, wear a crown,\nWear a bright and shining crown.\n\nMust I be carried to the skies\nOn flow'ry beds of ease\nWhile others fought to win the prize,\nAnd sailed through bloody seas?\n\nAre there no foes for me to face?\nMust I not stem the flood?\nIs this vile world a friend to grace\nTo help me on to God?\n\nSure I must fight if I would reign;\nIncrease my courage, Lord!\nI'll bear the toil endure the pain,\nSupported by the word. Amen."
