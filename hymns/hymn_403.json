Fellowship divine\nWe feebly struggle, they in glory shine;\nYet all are one in Thee, for all are Thine.\nAlleluia!\n\nAnd when the strife is fierce, the warfare long,\nSteals of the ear the distant triumph song,\nAnd hearts are brave again, and arms are strong.\nAlleluia!\n\nThe golden evening brightens in the west;\nSoon, soon to faithful warriors comes their rest;\nSweet is the calm of Paradise the blest.\nAlleluia!\n\nBut lo, there breaks a yet more glorious day;\nThe Saints triumphant rise in bright array;\nThe King of glory passes on His way. Alleluia!"
