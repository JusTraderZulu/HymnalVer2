    "lyrics": "O come and mourn with me awhile;\nO come ye to the Saviorâ€™s side;\nO come, together let us mourn;\nJesus, our Lord, is crucified.\n\nHave we no tears to shed for Him,\nWhile soldiers scoff and Jews deride?\nAh! look how patiently He hangs;\nJesus, our Lord, is crucified.\n\nHow fast His hands and feet are nailed;\nHis throat with parching thirst is dried;\nHis failing eyes are dimmed with blood;\nJesus, our Lord, is crucified.\n\nSeven times He spake, seven words of love;\nAnd all three hours His silence cried\nFor mercy on the souls of men;\nJesus, our Lord, is crucified.\n\nCome, let us stand beneath the cross;\nSo may the blood from out His side\nFall gently on us drop by drop;\nJesus, our Lord, is crucified.\n\nA broken heart, a fount of tears,\nAsk, and they will not be denied;\nLord Jesus, may we love and weep,\nSince Thou for us art crucified."
