    "lyrics": "1\nA ruler once came to Jesus by night\nTo ask Him the way of salvation and light;\nThe Master made answer in words true and plain,\n'Ye must be born again.'\n\nChorus:\nYe must be born again,\nYe must be born again;\nI verily, verily say unto thee,\nYe must be born again.\n\n2\nYe children of men, attend to the word\nSo solemnly uttered by Jesus the Lord;\nAnd let not this message to you be in vain,\nYe must be born again.\n\n3\nO ye who would enter this glorious rest,\nAnd sing with the ransomed the song of the blest,\nThe life everlasting if ye would obtain,\nYe must be born again.\n\n4\nA dear one in heaven thy heart yearns to see,\nAt the beautiful gate may be watching for thee,\nThen list to the note of this solemn refrain,\nYe must be born again."
