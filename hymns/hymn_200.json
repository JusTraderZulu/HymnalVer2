    "lyrics": "1. I've reached the land of corn and wine, and all its riches freely mine;\\nHere shines undimmed one blissful day, for all my night has passed away.\\n\\nCHORUS:\\nO Beulah Land, sweet Beulah Land, as on thy highest mount I stand,\\nI look away across the sea where mansions are prepared for me,\\nAnd view the shining glory shore—my Heaven, my home for evermore.\\n\\n2. My Saviour comes and walks with me, and sweet communion here have we;\\nHe gently leads me by His hand, for this is Heaven's border‑land.\\n\\n3. A sweet perfume upon the breeze is borne from ever‑vernal trees,\\nAnd flowers, that never‑fading grow, where streams of life for ever flow.\\n\\n4. The zephyrs seem to float to me sweet sounds of Heaven's melody,\\nAs angels with the white‑robed throng join in the sweet redemption song."
