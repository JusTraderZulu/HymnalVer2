    "lyrics": "1. Soldiers of Christ, arise\nAnd put your armor on\nStrong in the strength\nWhich God supplies\nThrough His Eternal Son.\n\n2. Strong in the Lord of Hosts,\nAnd His Mighty Power\nWho in the strength\nOf Jesus trusts,\nIs more than conqueror.\n\n3. Stand, then,\nIn His Great might,\nWith all His strength endued\nAnd take, to arm\nYou for the fight\nThe panoply of God.\n\n4. To keep your armor bright,\nAttend with constant care,\nStill walking\nIn your captain's sight,\nAnd watching unto prayer.\n\n5. From strength to strength go on\nWrestle, and fight, and pray\nTread all the powers\nOf darkness down\nAnd win the well-fought day.\n\n6. Then, having all things done,\nAnd every conflict passed,\nYe may o'er come\nThrough Christ alone,\nAnd stand complete at last."
