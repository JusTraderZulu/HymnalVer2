    "lyrics": "1. On the Resurrection morning\nSoul and body meet again;\nNo more sorrow, no more weeping,\nNo more pain!\n\n2. Here awhile they must be parted,\nAnd the flesh its Sabbath keep,\nWaiting in a Holy stillness\nWrapt in sleep.\n\n3. For a while the tired body\nLies with feet toward the morn;\nTill the last and brightest Easter\nDay be born.\n\n4. But the soul in contemplation\nUtters earnest prayer and strong,\nBursting at the Resurrection\nInto song.\n\n5. Soul and body reunited\nThenceforth nothing shall divide,\nWaking up in Christ's own likeness\nSatisfied.\n\n6. Oh! the beauty, oh! the gladness\nOf the resurrection day,\nWhich shall not through endless ages\nPass away!\n\n7. On that happy Easter morning\nAll the graves their dead restore;\nFather, sister, child, and mother,\nMeet once more.\n\n8. To that brightest of all meetings\nBring us, Jesu Christ at last;\nBy Thy Cross, through death and judgment,\nHolding fast."
