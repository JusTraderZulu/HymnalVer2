    "lyrics": "There is one way, and only one,\nOut of our gloom, and sin, and care,\nTo that far land\nWhere shines no sun\nBecause the face of God is there.\n\nThere is one truth, the truth of God,\nThat Christ came down\nFrom Heaven to show,\nOne life that His redeeming blood\nHas won for all His Saints below.\n\nThe lore from Philip once conceal'd,\nWe know its fullness now in Christ;\nIn Him the Father is reveal'd,\nAnd all our longing is sufficed.\n\nAnd still unwavering\nFaith holds sure\nThe words that James\nWrote sternly down;\nExcept we labour and endure,\nWe cannot win the Heavenly crown.\n\nO way Divine,\nThrough gloom and strife,\nBring us Thy Father's face to see;\nO Heavenly Truth, O precious Life,\nAt last, at last, we rest in Thee."
