  "lyrics": "O God, our help in ages past,\nOur hope for years to come,\nOur shelter from the stormy blast,\nAnd our eternal Home.\n\nBeneath the shadow of Thy\nthrone,\nThy Saints have dwelt secure,\nSufficient is Thine arm alone,\nAnd our defense is sure.\n\nBefore the hills in order stood,\nOr Earth received her frame,\nFrom everlasting Thou art God,\nTo endless years the same.\n\nA thousand ages in Thy sight,\nAre like an evening gone,\nShort as the watch that ends the\nnight,\nBefore the rising sun.\n\nTime, like an ever-rolling\nstream,\nBears all its sons away;\nThey fly forgotten, as a dream,\nDies at the opening day.\n\nO God, our help in ages past,\nOur hope for years to come,\nBe Thou our guard while troubles\nlast,\nAnd our eternal home."
