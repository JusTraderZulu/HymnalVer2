    "lyrics": "God moves in a mysterious way\nHis wonders to perform;\nHe plants His footsteps in the sea,\nAnd rides upon the storm.\n\nDeep in unfathomable mines\nOf never-failing skill,\nHe treasures up His bright designs\nAnd works His sovereign will.\n\nYe fearful Saints, fresh courage take\nThe clouds ye so much dread,\nAre big with mercy, and will break,\nIn blessings on your head.\n\nJudge not the Lord by feeble sense,\nBut trust Him for His grace;\nBehind a frowning providence\nHe hides a smiling face.\n\nHis purposes will ripen fast,\nUnfolding every hour;\nThe bud may have a bitter taste,\nBut sweet will be the flower.\n\nBlind unbelief is sure to err,\nAnd scan His work in vain;\nGod is His own interpreter,\nAnd He will make it plain."
