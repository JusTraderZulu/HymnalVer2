    "lyrics": "1. Standing on the promises of Christ my King,\nThrough eternal ages let His praises ring,\nGlory in the highest, I will shout and sing,\nStanding on the promises of God.\n\nChorus:\nStanding, standing,\nStanding on the promises of God my Savior;\nStanding, standing,\nI’m standing on the promises of God.\n\n2. Standing on the promises that cannot fail,\nWhen the howling storms of doubt and fear assail,\nBy the living Word of God I shall prevail,\nStanding on the promises of God.\n\n3. Standing on the promises I now can see\nPerfect, present cleansing in the blood for me;\nStanding in the liberty where Christ makes free,\nStanding on the promises of God.\n\n4. Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord,\nBound to Him eternally by love’s strong cord,\nOvercoming daily with the Spirit’s sword,\nStanding on the promises of God.\n\n5. Standing on the promises I cannot fall,\nList’ning every moment to the Spirit’s call,\nResting in my Savior as my all in all,\nStanding on the promises of God."
