    "lyrics": "Man is lonely by birth,\nMan is only a pilgrim on Earth,\nBorn to be a King,\nTime is but a temporary thing,\nOnly a loan while on Earth.\n\nLike the wind in a tree,\nMan has been\nRather reckless and free,\nThrown far and wide\nHe longs to settle down beside\nThe stream flowing\nThrough eternity.\n\nLike the grass on the lawn,\nHe will pass\nBy the way and be gone,\nA lesson to learn,\nWe walk but once,\nThere's no return,\nTime is always moving on.\n\nMan is longing for one,\nFor a song\nAnd a place in the sun\nA home up above,\nWhere every day\nIs lived in love,\nFor rest when the journey is done."
