    "lyrics": "There is a green hill far away,\nWithout a city wall,\nWhere the dear Lord was crucified,\nWho died to save us all.\n\nWe may not know, we cannot\ntell,\nWhat pains He had to bear,\nBut we believe it was for us,\nHe hung and suffered there.\n\nHe died that we might be\nforgiven,\nHe died to make us good,\nThat we might go at last to\nHeaven,\nSaved by His precious blood.\n\nThere was no other good\nenough,\nTo pay the price of sin,\nHe only could unlock the gate,\nOf Heaven and let us in.\n\nOh, dearly, dearly has He loved,\nAnd we must love Him too,\nAnd trust in His redeeming blood,\nAnd try His work to do."
