    "lyrics": "Forever here my rest shall be,\nClose to Thy bleeding side,\n'Tis all my hope and all my plea,\nFor me the Saviour died.\n\nMy dying Saviour and my God,\nFountain for guilt and sin;\nSprinkle me ever with Thy blood,\nAnd cleanse and keep me clean.\n\nWash me and make me Thus Thine own,\nWash me and mine Thou art,\nWash me but not my feet alone,\nMy hands, my head, my heart.\n\nThe atonement of Thy blood apply,\nTill faith to sight improve,\nTill hope in full fruition die,\nAnd all my soul be love."
