    "lyrics": "1\nO what a wonderful, wonderful\nday, day I will never forget;\nAfter I'd wandered in darkness\naway, Jesus my Savior I met.\nO what a tender, compassionate\nfriend, He met the need of my heart;\nShadows dispelling, with\njoy I am telling, He made\nall the darkness depart.\n\nChorus:\nHeaven came down and glory\nfilled my soul,\nWhen at the cross the Savior\nmade me whole;\nMy sins were washed away and\nmy night was turned to day,\nHeaven came down and glory\nfilled my soul!\n\n2\nBorn of the Spirit with life from\nabove into God's family divine,\nJustified fully thru Calvary's\nlove, O what a standing is mine!\nAnd the transaction so quickly was\nmade, when as a sinner I came,\nTook of the offer, of grace\nHe did proffer, He saved\nme, O praise His dear name!\n\n3\nNow I've a hope that will surely\nendure after the passing of time;\nI have a future in heaven for sure\nthere in those mansions sublime.\nAnd it's because of that wonderful\nday, when at the cross I believed;\nRiches eternal and blessings supernal,\nfrom His precious hand I received."
