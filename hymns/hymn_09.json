    "lyrics": "Jesus has a table spread\nWhere the Saints of God are fed\nHe invites His chosen people,\nCome and dine\nWith His manna He doth feed\nAnd supplies our every need\nO tis sweet to sup\nWith Jesus all the time.\n\nCHORUS:\nCome and dine, the Master calleth,\nCome and dine,\nYou may feast at Jesus' table\nAll the time\nHe who fed the multitude,\nTurned the water into wine\nTo the hungry calleth now,\nCome and dine.\n\nThe disciples came to land\nThus obeying Christ's command\nFor the Master called to them\nO come and dine,\nThere they found\nTheir heart's desire,\nBread and fish upon the fire\nThus He satisfies the hungry\nEvery time.\n\nSoon the Lamb will take His Bride\nTo be ever at His side\nAll the host of Heaven\nWill assembled be\nO 'twill be a glorious sight,\nAll the Saints in spotless white\nAnd with Jesus\nThey will feast eternally."
