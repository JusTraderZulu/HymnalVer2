  "lyrics": "O Master let me walk with Thee\nIn Lowly paths of service free,\nTell me Thy secrets, help me bear,\nThe strains of toil, the fret of care.\n\nHelp me the slow of heart to move,\nBy some clear winning word of love,\nTeach me the wayward feet to stay.\nAnd guide them in the homeward way.\n\nTeach me Thy patience; still with Thee,\nIn closer, dearer company,\nIn work that keeps faith sweet and strong,\nIn trust that triumphs over wrong.\n\nIn hope that sends a shining ray\nFar down the future broadening way,\nIn peace that only Thou canst give,\nWith Thee O Master let me live."
