  "lyrics": "My soul in sad exile\nWas out on life's sea\nSo burdened with sin\nAnd distressed\nTill I heard a sweet voice\nSaying make rne your choice\nAnd I entered the haven of rest.\n\nCHORUS:\nl've anchored my soul\nIn the Heaven of rest l'll sail\nThe wide seas no more\nThe tempest may sweep\nO'er the wild stormy deep\nIn Jesus I'm safe evermore.\n\nL yielded myself\nTo His tender embrace\nAnd faith taking hold\nOf the word\nMy fetters fell off\nAnd !anchored my soul\nThe haven of rest is my Lord.\n\nThe song of my soul\nSince the Lord made me whole\nHas been the old story so blest\nOf Jesus who'll save\nWhosoever will have\nA home in the haven of rest.\n\nHow precious the thought\nThat we all may recline\nLike John the beloved and blest\nOn Jesus' strong arm\nWhere no tempest can harm\nSecured in the haven of rest.\n\nO come to the Saviour\nHe patiently waits\nTo save by His power divine\nCome anchor your soul\nIn the haven of rest\nAnd say my Beloved is mine."
