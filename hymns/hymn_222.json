    "lyrics": "Hush'd was the evening hymn,\nThe temple courts were dark;\nThe lamp was burning.dim\nBefore the Sacred ark;\nWhen suddenly a Voice divine\nRang through the silence\nOf the shrine.\n\nThe old man, meek and mild,\nThe priest of Israel, slept;\nHis watch the Temple child,\nThe little Levite kept;\nAnd what from Eli's sense\nWas seal'd the Lord\nTo Hannah's son reveal'd.\n\nOh! give me Samuel's ear,\nThe open ear, O Lord,\nAlive and quick to hear\nEach whisper of Thy word;\nLike Him to answer\nAt Thy call, and to obey\nThee first of all.\n\nOh! give me Samuel's heart,\nA lowly heart, that waits\nWhere in Thy house Thou art,\nOr watches at Thy gates,\nBy day and night,\nA heart that still\nMoves at the breathing\nOf Thy will..\n\nOh! give me Samuel's mind\nA sweet unmurmuring faith,\nObedient and resign'd\nTo Thee in life and death;\nThat I may read\nWith child-like eyes\nTruths that are\nHidden from the wise."
