    "lyrics": "Jesus is tenderly calling Thee home,\nCalling today, calling today,\nWhy from the sunshine\nOf love wilt Thou roam,\nFarther and farther away?\n\nCHORUS\nCalling today,\nCalling today\nJesus is calling,\nIs tenderly calling today.\n\nJesus is calling the weary to rest,\nCalling today, calling today,\nBring Him Thy burden\nAnd Thou shalt be blest,\nHe will not turn Thee away.\n\nJesus is waiting,\nO come to Him now,\nWaiting today, waiting today,\nCome with thy sins,\nAt His feet lowly bow,\nCome, and no longer delay.\n\nJesus is pleading,\nO list to His voice,\nHear Him today, hear Him today,\nThey who believe\nOn His name shall rejoice,\nQuickly arise and away."
