King of my life I crown Thee now\nThine shall the glory be;\nLest I forget Thy thorn‑crowned brow,\nLead me to Calvary.\n\nCHORUS:\nLest I forget Gethsemane,\nLest I forget Thine agony,\nLest I forget Thy love for me,\nLead me to Calvary.\n\n2. Show me the tomb where Thou wast laid,\nTenderly mourned and wept;\nAngels in robes of light arrayed\nGuarded Thee whilst Thou slept.\n\n3. Let me like Mary through the gloom\nCome with a gift to Thee;\nShow to me now the empty tomb,\nLead me to Calvary.\n\n4. May I be willing, Lord, to bear\nDaily my cross for Thee;\nEven Thy cup of grief to share—\nThou hast borne all for me."
