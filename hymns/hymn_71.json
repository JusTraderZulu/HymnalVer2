    "lyrics": "When the toils of life are over\nAnd we lay our armor down\nAnd we bid farewell to Earth\nWith all its cares, We shall meet\nAnd greet our loved ones\nAnd our Christ we then shall crown\nIn the new Jerusalem.\n\nCHORUS:\nThere'll be singing,\nThere'll be shouting,\nWhen the Saints come marching home\nIn Jerusalem, In Jerusalem\nWaving palms with loud hosannas\nAs the King shall take His throne\nIn the new, In the new Jerusalem.\n\nTho the way is sometimes lonely\nHe will hold me with His hand\nThro' the testings and the trial\nI must go\nBut I’ll trust and gladly follow\nFor sometime l'll understand\nIn the new Jerusalem.\n\nWhen the last goodbye is spoken\nAnd the tear stains wiped away\nAnd our eyes shall catch\nA glimpse of glory fair\nThen with bounding hearts\nWe’ll meet Him\nWho hath washed our sins away\nIn the new Jerusalem.\n\nWhen we join the ransomed army\nIn the summer land above\nAnd the face of our dear Saviour\nWe behold\nWe will sing and shout forever\nAnd we’ll grow in perfect love\nIn the new Jerusalem."
