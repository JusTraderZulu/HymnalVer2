    "lyrics": "I must walk through the valley\nOf the shadow, but I'll journey\nIn a loving Saviour's care\nHe hath said He will never,\nNever leave me with His staff\nHe will comfort me there.\n\nCHORUS:\nThrough the valley,\nThrough the valley,\nThrough the valley\nOf the shadow I must go,\nBut the dark waves of Jordan\nWill not harm me, there is peace\nIn the valley I know.\n\nWhen I walk through the valley\nOf the shadow, all the weary days\nOf toiling will be o'er,\nFor the strong arms of Jesus will enfold me,\nAnd with Him I shall sorrow no more.\n\nThough I walk through the valley\nOf the shadow, yet the glory of\nThe dawning I shall see,\nI shall join in the Anthems over Jordan,\nWhere the loved ones are waiting for me.\n\nI shall walk through the valley\nOf the shadow, I shall follow where\nMy Lord has gone before,\nThrough the mists of the valley,\nHe will lead me, till I rest on\nThe ever green shore."
